FR-2: The user shall be able to view a daily summary of their total water intake.
FR-3: The user shall be able to set a daily water intake goal in ounces.
FR-4: The application shall display a visual progress bar indicating progress towards the daily goal.

**Testability:** All three approaches are testable, but Approach 2 and 3 have more directly testable user-facing features.

**Feasibility:** All three approaches are feasible.

**Alignment:** Approach 2 is the most aligned with the user story, as it directly addresses the user's need to track water intake and ensure hydration.

**FINAL RECOMMENDATION:**

The most effective set of requirements is **APPROACH 2: Focus on user experience and outcomes**.

FR-1: The user shall be able to log water intake in increments of 8oz, 12oz, 16oz, and custom amounts.
