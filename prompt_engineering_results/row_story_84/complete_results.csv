**Functional Requirements (FR):**

*   **FR-1: E-book Upload & Storage:** The system shall allow users to upload e-books in the following formats: EPUB, PDF, MOBI.
*   **FR-2: Device Registration:** The system shall allow users to register multiple devices (e.g., phone, tablet, e-reader, computer) with their account.

*   **FR-8: Sync Status Indication:** The system shall provide a visual indicator (e.g., icon, text message) to show the sync status (e.g., ""Syncing..."", ""Synced"", ""Error"") on each device.

**Non-Functional Requirements (NFR):**

*   **NFR-3: Data Security:** The system shall encrypt e-books and associated reading data (bookmarks, notes, etc.) both in transit and at rest using AES-256 encryption or equivalent.
*   **NFR-4: Data Consistency:** The system shall ensure data consistency across all registered devices by using a transactional database or similar mechanism to prevent data loss or corruption during synchronization.
*   **NFR-5: Scalability:** The system shall be scalable to support a large number of users and e-books without performance degradation. The system should be able to handle up to 10,000 concurrent sync requests without exceeding a 5-second response time.
*   **NFR-6: Bandwidth Usage:** The system shall minimize bandwidth usage during synchronization by only transferring the necessary changes (e.g., incremental updates to the reading position, bookmarks).

*   **NFR-8: Availability:** The system should be available 99.9% of the time, excluding scheduled maintenance windows.

**Explanation of choices and considerations:**

*   **Specificity:** The requirements are very specific (e.g., listing supported e-book formats, specifying encryption algorithms).
*   **Measurability:** Many requirements include measurable metrics (e.g., sync speed in seconds, number of concurrent requests, percentage of availability).
*   **Achievability:** The requirements are based on commonly used technologies and realistic performance expectations.
*   **Relevance:** The requirements directly address the user's need to sync e-books and pick up reading where they left off.
*   **Time-bound (Implied):** While not explicitly stated in every requirement, the measurable metrics inherently imply a time-bound element. For example, ""within 2 seconds"" is a time-bound constraint. The assumption is that the requirements will be tested and validated during the development cycle.

**Key Improvements over basic examples:**

*   **Conflict Resolution:**  Addresses the potential for conflicting data when a user reads on multiple devices.
*   **Offline Access:** Ensures the user can still read even without an internet connection (after the initial download).
*   **Battery Efficiency:** Considers the impact on mobile devices.
*   **Scalability:** Addresses the potential for a large user base.
*   **Bandwidth Usage:** Acknowledges the need to be efficient with data transfer.
*   **Data Consistency:** Considers the need for reliable updates.

Let's solve this requirement engineering task using a Reasoning-Action loop.

USER STORY:
As a user, I want to be able to sync my e-books across devices so that I can pick up where I left off on any device.

REASONING STEP 1:
Let's identify the core functionality requested in this user story. What is the primary action or outcome the user expects?

ACTION STEP 1:
FR-1: [Primary functional requirement based on the core need]
FR-2: [Secondary functional requirement that supports the core need]

REASONING STEP 2:
Now let's consider the triggers, conditions, and context for this functionality. What needs to happen before, during, and after the main function?

ACTION STEP 2:
FR-3: [Requirement related to preconditions or triggers]
FR-4: [Requirement related to process steps or data handling]

REASONING STEP 3:
We need to consider reliability, error conditions, and alternative paths. What happens when things don't work as expected?

ACTION STEP 3:
FR-5: [Requirement addressing error handling or alternative flows]
FR-6: [Requirement addressing backup functionality or notifications]
NFR-1: [Non-functional requirement related to performance or timing]

REASONING STEP 4:
Let's consider user experience, accessibility, and other quality attributes important for this feature.

ACTION STEP 4:
NFR-2: [Non-functional requirement related to user interface or experience]
NFR-3: [Non-functional requirement related to quality attributes like accessibility or security]

FINAL REQUIREMENTS:

FR-3: The user must be logged in to their account on each device to enable synchronization.
FR-4: The system shall periodically (every 5 minutes) check for updates to the user's reading position and other metadata and synchronize changes to the cloud storage.
FR-5: If synchronization fails due to network connectivity issues, the system shall store the changes locally and automatically attempt to synchronize when network connectivity is restored. A notification should be displayed to the user indicating that the sync is pending.
FR-6: The system shall automatically create a backup of the user's e-book library and associated metadata daily.
NFR-1: The synchronization process shall not consume more than 5% of the device's CPU resources.
