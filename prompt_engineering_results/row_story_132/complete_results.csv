Let's solve this requirement engineering task using a Reasoning-Action loop.

USER STORY:
As a user, I want to be able to view detailed information about the rental car, including its features, mileage, and any additional fees.

REASONING STEP 1:
Let's identify the core functionality requested in this user story. What is the primary action or outcome the user expects?

ACTION STEP 1:
FR-1: [Primary functional requirement based on the core need]
FR-2: [Secondary functional requirement that supports the core need]

REASONING STEP 2:
Now let's consider the triggers, conditions, and context for this functionality. What needs to happen before, during, and after the main function?

ACTION STEP 2:
FR-3: [Requirement related to preconditions or triggers]
FR-4: [Requirement related to process steps or data handling]

REASONING STEP 3:
We need to consider reliability, error conditions, and alternative paths. What happens when things don't work as expected?

ACTION STEP 3:
FR-5: [Requirement addressing error handling or alternative flows]
FR-6: [Requirement addressing backup functionality or notifications]
NFR-1: [Non-functional requirement related to performance or timing]

REASONING STEP 4:
Let's consider user experience, accessibility, and other quality attributes important for this feature.

ACTION STEP 4:
NFR-2: [Non-functional requirement related to user interface or experience]
NFR-3: [Non-functional requirement related to quality attributes like accessibility or security]

FINAL REQUIREMENTS:
[Comprehensive list of all requirements developed through the reasoning-action process]

I want you to only share the specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound functional (FR) and nonfunctional (NFR) requirements as follows and do not share your reasoning with me: :

and so on..
","FR-1: The system shall display a detailed view of a rental car, including its features (e.g., number of seats, fuel type, transmission type), mileage (current odometer reading), and any associated additional fees (e.g., late return fee, cleaning fee, mileage overage fee).
FR-2: The system shall allow the user to navigate to the detailed rental car view from a search results list or a booking confirmation page.
FR-3: The system shall require the user to be logged in or have a valid session before accessing the detailed rental car view.
FR-4: The system shall retrieve rental car details from the car database when the user navigates to the detailed view, using the car's unique identifier.
FR-5: If the car details are not found in the database, the system shall display an error message ""Car details not found"" and provide a link to return to the previous page.
FR-6: The system shall log any errors encountered while retrieving or displaying car details to a system log for debugging purposes.
NFR-1: The detailed rental car view shall load within 3 seconds.
NFR-2: The detailed rental car view shall be displayed in a clear and organized format, with easily readable text and sufficient spacing between elements.
NFR-3: The detailed rental car view shall be accessible to users with disabilities, adhering to WCAG 2.1 Level AA accessibility guidelines.
