Now let's consider the triggers, conditions, and context for this functionality. What needs to happen before, during, and after the main function?

ACTION STEP 2:
FR-3: [Requirement related to preconditions or triggers]
FR-4: [Requirement related to process steps or data handling]

REASONING STEP 3:
We need to consider reliability, error conditions, and alternative paths. What happens when things don't work as expected?

ACTION STEP 3:
FR-5: [Requirement addressing error handling or alternative flows]
FR-6: [Requirement addressing backup functionality or notifications]
NFR-1: [Non-functional requirement related to performance or timing]

REASONING STEP 4:
Let's consider user experience, accessibility, and other quality attributes important for this feature.

ACTION STEP 4:
NFR-2: [Non-functional requirement related to user interface or experience]
NFR-3: [Non-functional requirement related to quality attributes like accessibility or security]

","FR-1: The system shall display property locations as visual markers on a map.
FR-2: The system shall allow users to zoom in and out on the map.
FR-3: The system shall load property data within 3 seconds of the map being displayed.
FR-4: The system shall retrieve property data from a defined data source (e.g., API endpoint) when the map is loaded or when the map view changes significantly (e.g., zoom level or center point).
FR-5: The system shall display an error message to the user if property data cannot be retrieved, indicating the reason for the failure.
FR-6: The system shall provide a mechanism to refresh the map and property data.
NFR-1: The map shall load and display property markers within 5 seconds.
NFR-2: The property markers shall be clearly distinguishable and easily selectable on the map.
NFR-3: The map shall be accessible to users with disabilities, adhering to WCAG 2.1 Level AA guidelines.

Let's solve this requirement engineering task using a Reasoning-Action loop.

USER STORY:
As a user, I want to be able to view properties on a map so that I can easily see their location and proximity to important landmarks.

REASONING STEP 1:
Let's identify the core functionality requested in this user story. What is the primary action or outcome the user expects?

ACTION STEP 1:
FR-1: [Primary functional requirement based on the core need]
FR-2: [Secondary functional requirement that supports the core need]

REASONING STEP 2:
Now let's consider the triggers, conditions, and context for this functionality. What needs to happen before, during, and after the main function?

ACTION STEP 2:
FR-3: [Requirement related to preconditions or triggers]

","FR-1: The system shall display property locations as markers on a map interface.
FR-2: The system shall allow users to filter properties based on criteria such as price range, property type, and number of bedrooms.
FR-3: The system shall load property data for display on the map within 3 seconds of the map being initialized or the map viewport changing significantly (e.g., zoom level or center point).
FR-4: The system shall retrieve property data from a designated property database using a secure API.
FR-5: The system shall display an error message to the user if property data cannot be loaded, suggesting troubleshooting steps (e.g., checking internet connection).
FR-6: The system shall provide a mechanism to manually refresh the property data displayed on the map if automatic loading fails.
NFR-1: The map interface shall respond to user interactions (e.g., zooming, panning, clicking on markers) within 200 milliseconds.
NFR-2: Property markers shall be visually distinct and easily identifiable on the map.
NFR-3: The map interface shall be accessible to users with disabilities, adhering to WCAG 2.1 Level AA guidelines for color contrast and keyboard navigation.
