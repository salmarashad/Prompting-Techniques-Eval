FR-1: 
FR-2:
NFR-1: 
NFR-2:
and so on..
","Okay, here are the three sets of SMART requirements, followed by the evaluation and final recommendation.

**APPROACH 1: Focus on technical implementation details**

FR-1: The system shall retrieve property data from the `PropertyData` database table.
FR-2: The system shall use the `HistoricalDataAPI` to fetch historical property values.
FR-3: The system shall display data in a JSON format.
NFR-1: The `HistoricalDataAPI` shall respond to requests within 500ms.
NFR-2: The system shall use HTTPS for all data transmissions.

**APPROACH 2: Focus on user experience and outcomes**

FR-1: The user shall be able to view historical property data for the last 5 years.
FR-2: The user shall be able to filter historical data by year.
FR-3: The user shall be able to view historical data in a chart format.
NFR-1: The historical data shall load within 3 seconds of the user requesting it.
NFR-2: The chart shall be accessible to users with screen readers.

**APPROACH 3: Focus on business rules and data handling**

FR-1: The system shall calculate the annual appreciation rate for each property.
FR-2: The system shall display the average sale price for similar properties in the area.
FR-3: The system shall only display data for properties with at least 3 years of historical data.
NFR-1: Data shall be updated daily at 3:00 AM PST.
NFR-2: The system shall comply with all applicable data privacy regulations (e.g., GDPR, CCPA).

**EVALUATION:**

**Completeness:**

*   Approach 1: Least complete. Misses key aspects of user interaction and business logic.
*   Approach 2: More complete than Approach 1, focusing on user interaction.
*   Approach 3: Most complete, covering business rules and data handling in addition to some user-facing aspects.

**Clarity:**

*   Approach 1: Clear but too technical.
*   Approach 2: Clear and easy to understand from a user perspective.
*   Approach 3: Clear, but some requirements might need further clarification (e.g., ""similar properties"").

**Testability:**

*   Approach 1: Highly testable due to specific technical details.
*   Approach 2: Testable, but requires defining specific acceptance criteria for user experience (e.g., what constitutes an ""accessible"" chart).
*   Approach 3: Testable, but requires defining specific criteria for business rules (e.g., how ""similar properties"" are determined).

**Feasibility:**

*   Approach 1: Highly feasible, as it focuses on existing system components.
*   Approach 2: Feasible, but requires consideration of UI/UX design and accessibility.
*   Approach 3: Feasible, but requires careful consideration of data quality and business rule implementation.

**Alignment:**

*   Approach 1: Weakly aligned with the user story. Focuses on implementation rather than user need.
*   Approach 2: Strongly aligned with the user story, focusing on user experience and outcomes.
*   Approach 3: Moderately aligned with the user story, focusing on data and business rules that support the user's understanding of property value.

**FINAL RECOMMENDATION:**

The most effective set of requirements is a combination of Approach 2 and Approach 3. Approach 2 focuses on the user experience and outcomes, while Approach 3 focuses on the business rules and data handling that are necessary to provide the user with the information they need. Approach 1 is too focused on technical implementation details and does not adequately address the user's needs.

Here is a combined set of requirements based on Approach 2 and Approach 3:

FR-1: The user shall be able to view historical property data for the last 5 years.
FR-2: The user shall be able to filter historical data by year.
FR-3: The user shall be able to view historical data in a chart format.
FR-4: The system shall calculate the annual appreciation rate for each property.
FR-5: The system shall display the average sale price for similar properties in the area.
FR-6: The system shall only display data for properties with at least 3 years of historical data.
NFR-1: The historical data shall load within 3 seconds of the user requesting it.
NFR-2: The chart shall be accessible to users with screen readers.
NFR-3: Data shall be updated daily at 3:00 AM PST.
NFR-4: The system shall comply with all applicable data privacy regulations (e.g., GDPR, CCPA).

Let's identify the core functionality requested in this user story. What is the primary action or outcome the user expects?

ACTION STEP 1:
FR-1: [Primary functional requirement based on the core need]
FR-2: [Secondary functional requirement that supports the core need]

REASONING STEP 2:
Now let's consider the triggers, conditions, and context for this functionality. What needs to happen before, during, and after the main function?

ACTION STEP 2:
FR-3: [Requirement related to preconditions or triggers]
FR-4: [Requirement related to process steps or data handling]

REASONING STEP 3:
We need to consider reliability, error conditions, and alternative paths. What happens when things don't work as expected?

ACTION STEP 3:
FR-5: [Requirement addressing error handling or alternative flows]
FR-6: [Requirement addressing backup functionality or notifications]
NFR-1: [Non-functional requirement related to performance or timing]

REASONING STEP 4:
Let's consider user experience, accessibility, and other quality attributes important for this feature.

ACTION STEP 4:
NFR-2: [Non-functional requirement related to user interface or experience]
NFR-3: [Non-functional requirement related to quality attributes like accessibility or security]

FINAL REQUIREMENTS:
[Comprehensive list of all requirements developed through the reasoning-action process]

I want you to only share the specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound functional (FR) and nonfunctional (NFR) requirements as follows and do not share your reasoning with me: :
