Let's solve this requirement engineering task using a Reasoning-Action loop.

USER STORY:
As a team member, I want to be able to log time spent on tasks so that I can track my productivity and contribute to accurate billing.

REASONING STEP 1:
Let's identify the core functionality requested in this user story. What is the primary action or outcome the user expects?

ACTION STEP 1:
FR-1: [Primary functional requirement based on the core need]
FR-2: [Secondary functional requirement that supports the core need]

REASONING STEP 2:
Now let's consider the triggers, conditions, and context for this functionality. What needs to happen before, during, and after the main function?

ACTION STEP 2:
FR-3: [Requirement related to preconditions or triggers]
FR-4: [Requirement related to process steps or data handling]

REASONING STEP 3:
We need to consider reliability, error conditions, and alternative paths. What happens when things don't work as expected?

ACTION STEP 3:
FR-5: [Requirement addressing error handling or alternative flows]
FR-6: [Requirement addressing backup functionality or notifications]
NFR-1: [Non-functional requirement related to performance or timing]

REASONING STEP 4:
Let's consider user experience, accessibility, and other quality attributes important for this feature.

ACTION STEP 4:
NFR-2: [Non-functional requirement related to user interface or experience]
NFR-3: [Non-functional requirement related to quality attributes like accessibility or security]

FINAL REQUIREMENTS:
[Comprehensive list of all requirements developed through the reasoning-action process]

I want you to only share the specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound functional (FR) and nonfunctional (NFR) requirements as follows and do not share your reasoning with me: :

and so on..
","FR-1: The system shall allow a user to log the amount of time (in hours and minutes) spent on a specific task.
FR-2: The system shall associate each time log entry with a specific user, task, and date.
FR-3: The system shall require the user to be authenticated before logging time.
FR-4: The system shall store all time log entries in a persistent data store.
FR-5: The system shall display an error message if the user attempts to log time exceeding 24 hours in a single day.
FR-6: The system shall provide a confirmation message to the user upon successful creation of a time log entry.
NFR-1: The system shall record a time log entry within 2 seconds of the user submitting the information.
NFR-2: The time logging interface shall be intuitive and require minimal steps to log time for a task.
NFR-3: The system shall ensure that only authorized users can access and modify their own time log data.
