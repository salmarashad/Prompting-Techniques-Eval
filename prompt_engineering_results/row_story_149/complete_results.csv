*   **SMART Criteria:** Each requirement is written to be specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound:
    *   **Specific:** Clearly defines what the system should do or how it should perform.
    *   **Measurable:** Includes metrics or thresholds that can be used to determine if the requirement has been met (e.g., ""update the displayed stock price at least every 5 seconds,"" ""data latency shall not exceed 2 seconds"").
    *   **Achievable:** Realistic within the scope of the project and available resources.
    *   **Relevant:** Directly supports the user's need to make informed investment decisions.
    *   **Time-bound:** Includes specific time constraints (e.g., ""within 3 seconds"").
