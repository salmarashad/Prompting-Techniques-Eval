Convert the following user story into specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound software requirements by following these steps:

USER STORY:
As a user, I want to be able to connect with other users on the social media platform, such as by following them or sending them friend requests.

Follow these steps to derive the requirements:

1. Identify the actor (Who is performing the action?)
   - Who is the primary user in this story?
   - What is their role in the system?

2. Identify the action (What do they want to do?)
   - What specific functionality is being requested?
   - What system components would be involved?

3. Identify the goal (Why do they want to do it?)
   - What is the underlying user need?
   - How does this relate to business objectives?

4. Extract assumptions and constraints
   - What implicit needs are not directly stated?
   - What technical or business constraints might apply?

5. Derive detailed functional requirements (FR) from the analysis performed in the previous steps.
   - What specific behaviors must the system exhibit?
   - What are the inputs, processes, and outputs?

6. Derive non-functional requirements (NFR) from the analysis performed in the previous steps.
   - What quality attributes are important (performance, security, usability)?
   - What measurable criteria should apply?

Based on the analysis performed in the steps above, provide a numbered list of clear, specific, and testable functional (FR) and non-functional (NFR) requirements.

","Okay, I will convert the user story ""As a user, I want to be able to connect with other users on the social media platform, such as by following them or sending them friend requests"" into SMART functional and non-functional requirements.

FR-1: **Follow User:** The system shall allow a logged-in user to follow another user. When a user initiates a follow request, the system shall record the follower/following relationship within 0.5 seconds and the followed user shall receive a notification (if configured by the followed user) within 1 minute. This functionality must be fully implemented by [Date: End of next sprint, e.g., 2024-05-03].

FR-2: **Unfollow User:** The system shall allow a logged-in user to unfollow another user they are currently following. Upon initiation, the system shall remove the follower/following relationship within 0.5 seconds. The unfollowed user will not be notified. This functionality must be fully implemented by [Date: End of next sprint, e.g., 2024-05-03].

FR-3: **Send Friend Request:** The system shall allow a logged-in user to send a friend request to another user. The friend request must be delivered to the recipient within 1 minute. This functionality must be fully implemented by [Date: End of next sprint + 1 week, e.g., 2024-05-10].

FR-4: **Accept Friend Request:** The system shall allow a user to accept a friend request. Upon acceptance, the system shall establish a two-way friendship connection between the users in the database within 0.5 seconds, and both users shall be notified of the successful connection within 1 minute. This functionality must be fully implemented by [Date: End of next sprint + 1 week, e.g., 2024-05-10].

FR-5: **Reject Friend Request:** The system shall allow a user to reject a friend request. Upon rejection, the system shall remove the pending friend request record from the database within 0.5 seconds, and the requesting user will not be notified. This functionality must be fully implemented by [Date: End of next sprint + 1 week, e.g., 2024-05-10].

FR-6: **List Followers/Following:** The system shall allow a user to view a list of users who are following them (""followers"") and a list of users they are following (""following""). These lists should be displayed within 2 seconds and paginated to show a maximum of 20 users per page. This functionality must be fully implemented by [Date: End of next sprint + 2 weeks, e.g., 2024-05-17].

NFR-1: **Scalability:** The system shall support at least 10,000 concurrent users sending and accepting friend requests without a noticeable performance degradation (response times should remain under 2 seconds for the 95th percentile of requests).

Let's solve this requirement engineering task using a Reasoning-Action loop.

USER STORY:
As a user, I want to be able to connect with other users on the social media platform, such as by following them or sending them friend requests.

REASONING STEP 1:
Let's identify the core functionality requested in this user story. What is the primary action or outcome the user expects?

ACTION STEP 1:
FR-1: [Primary functional requirement based on the core need]
FR-2: [Secondary functional requirement that supports the core need]

REASONING STEP 2:
Now let's consider the triggers, conditions, and context for this functionality. What needs to happen before, during, and after the main function?

ACTION STEP 2:
FR-3: [Requirement related to preconditions or triggers]
FR-4: [Requirement related to process steps or data handling]

REASONING STEP 3:
We need to consider reliability, error conditions, and alternative paths. What happens when things don't work as expected?

ACTION STEP 3:
FR-5: [Requirement addressing error handling or alternative flows]
FR-6: [Requirement addressing backup functionality or notifications]
NFR-1: [Non-functional requirement related to performance or timing]

REASONING STEP 4:
Let's consider user experience, accessibility, and other quality attributes important for this feature.

ACTION STEP 4:
NFR-2: [Non-functional requirement related to user interface or experience]
NFR-3: [Non-functional requirement related to quality attributes like accessibility or security]
