Let's solve this requirement engineering task using a Reasoning-Action loop.

USER STORY:
As a user, I want to be able to set reminders for events in my personal calendar, so that I don't forget important appointments.

REASONING STEP 1:
Let's identify the core functionality requested in this user story. What is the primary action or outcome the user expects?

ACTION STEP 1:
FR-1: [Primary functional requirement based on the core need]
FR-2: [Secondary functional requirement that supports the core need]

REASONING STEP 2:
Now let's consider the triggers, conditions, and context for this functionality. What needs to happen before, during, and after the main function?

ACTION STEP 2:
FR-3: [Requirement related to preconditions or triggers]
FR-4: [Requirement related to process steps or data handling]

REASONING STEP 3:
We need to consider reliability, error conditions, and alternative paths. What happens when things don't work as expected?

ACTION STEP 3:
FR-5: [Requirement addressing error handling or alternative flows]
FR-6: [Requirement addressing backup functionality or notifications]
NFR-1: [Non-functional requirement related to performance or timing]

REASONING STEP 4:
Let's consider user experience, accessibility, and other quality attributes important for this feature.

ACTION STEP 4:
NFR-2: [Non-functional requirement related to user interface or experience]
NFR-3: [Non-functional requirement related to quality attributes like accessibility or security]

FINAL REQUIREMENTS:
[Comprehensive list of all requirements developed through the reasoning-action process]

I want you to only share the specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound functional (FR) and nonfunctional (NFR) requirements as follows and do not share your reasoning with me: : 

FR-1: 
FR-2:
NFR-1: 
NFR-2:
and so on..
","FR-1: The system shall allow users to set a reminder for an event in their calendar.
FR-2: The system shall store the reminder setting associated with the corresponding event.
FR-3: The user must have an event created in their calendar before setting a reminder for it.
FR-4: The system shall trigger a notification to the user at the specified reminder time before the event start time.
FR-5: If the notification fails to deliver, the system shall attempt to resend the notification up to 3 times within a 5-minute window.
FR-6: The system shall allow users to choose the notification method (e.g., email, push notification, SMS).
NFR-1: The reminder notification shall be delivered to the user within 1 minute of the scheduled reminder time, 99% of the time.
NFR-2: The interface for setting a reminder shall be intuitive and require no more than 3 clicks.
NFR-3: The system shall comply with all relevant data privacy regulations regarding the storage and handling of reminder settings and notification preferences.
