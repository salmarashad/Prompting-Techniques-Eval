Let's solve this requirement engineering task using a Reasoning-Action loop.

USER STORY:
As a user, I want to be able to find healthy recipes that fit my dietary needs.

REASONING STEP 1:
Let's identify the core functionality requested in this user story. What is the primary action or outcome the user expects?

ACTION STEP 1:
FR-1: [Primary functional requirement based on the core need]
FR-2: [Secondary functional requirement that supports the core need]

REASONING STEP 2:
Now let's consider the triggers, conditions, and context for this functionality. What needs to happen before, during, and after the main function?

ACTION STEP 2:
FR-3: [Requirement related to preconditions or triggers]
FR-4: [Requirement related to process steps or data handling]

REASONING STEP 3:
We need to consider reliability, error conditions, and alternative paths. What happens when things don't work as expected?

ACTION STEP 3:
FR-5: [Requirement addressing error handling or alternative flows]
FR-6: [Requirement addressing backup functionality or notifications]
NFR-1: [Non-functional requirement related to performance or timing]

REASONING STEP 4:
Let's consider user experience, accessibility, and other quality attributes important for this feature.

NFR-2: [Non-functional requirement related to user interface or experience]
NFR-3: [Non-functional requirement related to quality attributes like accessibility or security]

","FR-1: The system shall allow users to search for recipes based on dietary needs (e.g., vegetarian, vegan, gluten-free, dairy-free, nut-free).
FR-2: The system shall display a list of recipes that match the user's specified dietary needs.
FR-3: The system shall allow users to specify multiple dietary needs to filter recipes.
FR-4: The system shall store and manage recipe information, including ingredients, instructions, and dietary information.
FR-5: The system shall display an error message if no recipes are found that match the user's specified dietary needs.
FR-6: The system shall provide a feedback mechanism for users to report incorrect dietary information for recipes.
