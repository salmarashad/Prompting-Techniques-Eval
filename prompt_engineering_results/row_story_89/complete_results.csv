You are a Senior Requirements Engineer with 15 years of experience in software development. Your expertise is in translating business needs into technical specifications that bridge business goals and development work.

APPROACH THIS TASK AS A PROFESSIONAL WOULD:
- Consider system architecture implications
- Think about integration points with other systems
- Address security and compliance needs
- Consider maintenance and supportability

USER STORY:
As a user, I want to be able to share my reading experience with others so that I can discuss books and recommendations with friends and family.

Produce a set of professional-grade specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound requirements that would be ready for development team implementation. Include:
1. Numbered functional requirements (with FR prefix)
2. Numbered non-functional requirements (with NFR prefix)
3. Potential risks or dependencies

","FR-1: The system shall allow users to share book information (title, author, cover image) and their reading status (e.g., ""Currently Reading,"" ""Finished,"" ""Want to Read"") with other users of the system.
FR-2: The system shall provide a mechanism for users to create and join groups of other users to facilitate discussions and recommendations related to books.
FR-3: Users must be logged in to the system to share their reading experience or participate in group discussions.
FR-4: The system shall store and display shared reading experiences in a user's profile and within relevant group pages.
FR-5: The system shall provide an error message to the user if sharing fails due to network connectivity issues or server errors.
FR-6: The system shall provide a notification to the user when their shared reading experience is successfully posted and visible to others.
NFR-1: The system shall display shared reading experiences within 2 seconds of the user requesting to view them.
NFR-2: The user interface for sharing reading experiences shall be intuitive and easy to navigate, requiring no more than 3 clicks to share a book and its status.
NFR-3: The system shall ensure that shared reading experiences are only visible to the user's chosen audience (e.g., friends, groups) based on privacy settings.

Let's solve this requirement engineering task using a Reasoning-Action loop.

USER STORY:
As a user, I want to be able to share my reading experience with others so that I can discuss books and recommendations with friends and family.

REASONING STEP 1:
Let's identify the core functionality requested in this user story. What is the primary action or outcome the user expects?

ACTION STEP 1:
FR-1: [Primary functional requirement based on the core need]
FR-2: [Secondary functional requirement that supports the core need]

REASONING STEP 2:
Now let's consider the triggers, conditions, and context for this functionality. What needs to happen before, during, and after the main function?

ACTION STEP 2:
FR-3: [Requirement related to preconditions or triggers]
FR-4: [Requirement related to process steps or data handling]

REASONING STEP 3:
We need to consider reliability, error conditions, and alternative paths. What happens when things don't work as expected?

ACTION STEP 3:
FR-5: [Requirement addressing error handling or alternative flows]
FR-6: [Requirement addressing backup functionality or notifications]
NFR-1: [Non-functional requirement related to performance or timing]

REASONING STEP 4:
Let's consider user experience, accessibility, and other quality attributes important for this feature.

ACTION STEP 4:
NFR-2: [Non-functional requirement related to user interface or experience]
NFR-3: [Non-functional requirement related to quality attributes like accessibility or security]

","FR-1: The system shall allow users to share a book title and their reading progress (e.g., page number, chapter) with selected users.
FR-2: The system shall allow users to post reviews and ratings of books to share with selected users or publicly.
FR-3: Users must be authenticated and logged in before they can share their reading experience.
FR-4: The system shall store the shared reading experience data, including the book title, user's progress, review, rating, and recipient list.
FR-5: If sharing fails (e.g., due to network error or recipient not found), the system shall display an error message to the user and allow them to retry.
FR-6: The system shall send a notification to the recipient user(s) when a reading experience is shared with them.
NFR-1: Sharing a reading experience shall complete within 3 seconds of the user initiating the action.
NFR-2: The user interface for sharing reading experiences shall be intuitive and easy to use, with clear options for selecting recipients and privacy settings.
NFR-3: The system shall ensure that shared reading experiences are only visible to the intended recipients, based on user-defined privacy settings.
