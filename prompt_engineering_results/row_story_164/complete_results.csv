**Functional Requirements (FR)**

FR-1: The system shall provide a dedicated ""Profile"" section accessible from the job seeker's dashboard or navigation menu.
FR-2: The system shall allow job seekers to update the following profile fields:
    *   Full Name

    *   Skills (Ability to add, edit, and delete skills from a pre-defined list or add custom skills. Limit of 20 skills.)
    *   Links to online profiles (e.g., LinkedIn, GitHub, Portfolio Website) (Limit of 5 links)
FR-3: The system shall validate that the email address entered is in a valid email format before saving changes.

FR-7: The system shall allow the user to upload a profile picture.
FR-8: The system shall support profile picture uploads in .jpg, .jpeg, and .png formats, with a maximum file size of 2MB.

**Non-Functional Requirements (NFR)**

NFR-1: The system shall save profile updates within 2 seconds of the user clicking the ""Save"" or ""Update"" button under normal load conditions (defined as fewer than 100 concurrent users updating their profiles).
NFR-2: The Profile section shall load within 3 seconds under normal load conditions.
NFR-3: The system shall ensure data integrity by implementing mechanisms to prevent data loss during profile updates (e.g., using database transactions).
NFR-4: The profile information shall be stored securely, protecting it from unauthorized access or modification.
NFR-5: The system shall be responsive and accessible on a range of devices and screen sizes, including desktops, tablets, and smartphones.
NFR-6: The user interface for updating the profile shall be intuitive and easy to navigate. Users should be able to update their profile with minimal training.

NFR-8: Error messages displayed during profile updates shall be clear, concise, and actionable, guiding the user on how to correct the issue.

**Explanation of Choices:**

*   **Specific:**  Each requirement describes a particular function or quality.
*   **Measurable:**  The requirements include metrics like time limits (e.g., 2 seconds, 3 seconds), file size limits (e.g., 2MB), character limits, number of allowed entries, and specific technologies/formats.
*   **Achievable:**  The requirements are realistic given typical web application development capabilities.
*   **Relevant:**  The requirements directly support the user story goal of easily updating a job application profile.
*   **Time-Bound:**  The response time requirements are specified to ensure performance.

**Key Considerations:**

*   **Pre-Defined List (Skills):** FR-2 specifies a pre-defined list for skills. This implies that the system must also provide a means to administer this list. This could be added as another user story (""As an administrator, I want to be able to maintain the list of available skills for job seekers."") and then converted into its own set of requirements.
*   **Error Handling:** NFR-8 addresses the importance of providing helpful error messages, which is vital for user experience.
*   **Accessibility:** NFR-7 ensures the profile section is usable by everyone, regardless of disability.
*   **Data Security:** NFR-4 addresses the security of the profile information. More detailed security requirements might be needed as the project progresses (e.g., related to password hashing, data encryption at rest, etc.).
*   **Load Conditions:** NFR-1 defines ""normal load conditions."" It's important to define these realistically based on expected user activity.

This detailed breakdown should give you a good starting point for developing the ""update profile"" functionality. Remember that this is just an initial set of requirements, and they may evolve as you gather more information and refine your understanding of the user needs.

Convert the following user story into specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound software requirements by following these steps:

USER STORY:
As a job seeker, I want to be able to easily update my job application profile, so that I can keep my job application up-to-date.

Follow these steps to derive the requirements:

1. Identify the actor (Who is performing the action?)
   - Who is the primary user in this story?
   - What is their role in the system?

2. Identify the action (What do they want to do?)
   - What specific functionality is being requested?
   - What system components would be involved?

3. Identify the goal (Why do they want to do it?)
   - What is the underlying user need?
   - How does this relate to business objectives?

4. Extract assumptions and constraints
   - What implicit needs are not directly stated?
   - What technical or business constraints might apply?

5. Derive detailed functional requirements (FR) from the analysis performed in the previous steps.
   - What specific behaviors must the system exhibit?
   - What are the inputs, processes, and outputs?

6. Derive non-functional requirements (NFR) from the analysis performed in the previous steps.
   - What quality attributes are important (performance, security, usability)?
   - What measurable criteria should apply?

Based on the analysis performed in the steps above, provide a numbered list of clear, specific, and testable functional (FR) and non-functional (NFR) requirements.

Let's identify the core functionality requested in this user story. What is the primary action or outcome the user expects?

ACTION STEP 1:
FR-1: [Primary functional requirement based on the core need]
FR-2: [Secondary functional requirement that supports the core need]

REASONING STEP 2:
Now let's consider the triggers, conditions, and context for this functionality. What needs to happen before, during, and after the main function?

ACTION STEP 2:
FR-3: [Requirement related to preconditions or triggers]
FR-4: [Requirement related to process steps or data handling]

REASONING STEP 3:
We need to consider reliability, error conditions, and alternative paths. What happens when things don't work as expected?

ACTION STEP 3:
FR-5: [Requirement addressing error handling or alternative flows]
FR-6: [Requirement addressing backup functionality or notifications]
NFR-1: [Non-functional requirement related to performance or timing]

REASONING STEP 4:
Let's consider user experience, accessibility, and other quality attributes important for this feature.

ACTION STEP 4:
NFR-2: [Non-functional requirement related to user interface or experience]
NFR-3: [Non-functional requirement related to quality attributes like accessibility or security]

FINAL REQUIREMENTS:
