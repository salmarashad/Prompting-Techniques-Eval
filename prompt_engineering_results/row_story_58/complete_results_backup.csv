FR-5: The system shall return search results within 2 seconds after the user applies the filter.
NFR-1: The filtering mechanism shall be implemented using the existing database schema.
NFR-2: The filtering mechanism shall be compatible with the existing search API.

**APPROACH 2: Focus on user experience and outcomes**

FR-1: The user shall be able to select multiple filter criteria simultaneously.

FR-5: The system shall provide visual feedback to indicate which filters are currently active.
NFR-1: The filter interface shall be intuitive and easy to use on both desktop and mobile devices.
NFR-2: The filter options shall be logically grouped and organized for easy navigation.

**APPROACH 3: Focus on business rules and data handling**

FR-1: The system shall only allow filtering by criteria for which data is available in the property database.
FR-2: The system shall enforce data type validation for filter inputs (e.g., numeric values for price and bedrooms).

**EVALUATION:**

**Completeness:** Approach 2 is the most complete, covering user interaction and visual feedback. Approach 1 is too focused on implementation, and Approach 3 is too focused on backend rules.

**Clarity:** All approaches are relatively clear, but Approach 2 uses more user-centric language.

**Testability:** All approaches are testable, but Approach 1 might lead to over-testing specific SQL queries rather than the overall filtering functionality.

**Feasibility:** All approaches are feasible.

**Alignment:** Approach 2 best aligns with the user story's goal of quickly finding properties that meet preferences.

**FINAL RECOMMENDATION:**

The most effective set of requirements is **Approach 2**, with some elements incorporated from Approach 3.

FR-1: The user shall be able to select multiple filter criteria simultaneously.
FR-2: The user shall be able to clear all applied filters with a single action.
FR-3: The system shall display the number of results matching the applied filters in real-time as filters are applied.

As a user, I want to be able to filter search results by specific criteria so that I can quickly find properties that meet my preferences.

REASONING STEP 1:
Let's identify the core functionality requested in this user story. What is the primary action or outcome the user expects?

ACTION STEP 1:
FR-1: [Primary functional requirement based on the core need]
FR-2: [Secondary functional requirement that supports the core need]

REASONING STEP 2:
Now let's consider the triggers, conditions, and context for this functionality. What needs to happen before, during, and after the main function?

ACTION STEP 2:
FR-3: [Requirement related to preconditions or triggers]
FR-4: [Requirement related to process steps or data handling]

REASONING STEP 3:
We need to consider reliability, error conditions, and alternative paths. What happens when things don't work as expected?

ACTION STEP 3:
FR-5: [Requirement addressing error handling or alternative flows]
FR-6: [Requirement addressing backup functionality or notifications]
NFR-1: [Non-functional requirement related to performance or timing]

REASONING STEP 4:
Let's consider user experience, accessibility, and other quality attributes important for this feature.

ACTION STEP 4:
NFR-2: [Non-functional requirement related to user interface or experience]
NFR-3: [Non-functional requirement related to quality attributes like accessibility or security]

FINAL REQUIREMENTS:
[Comprehensive list of all requirements developed through the reasoning-action process]

I want you to only share the specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound functional (FR) and nonfunctional (NFR) requirements as follows and do not share your reasoning with me: :

","FR-1: The system shall allow users to specify one or more filter criteria (e.g., price range, number of bedrooms, location) before or during a search.

FR-2: The system shall display the number of search results matching the specified filter criteria.

FR-3: The system shall require users to initiate a search (e.g., by entering a location or keyword) before filter options are presented.

FR-4: The system shall apply the selected filter criteria to the search results and update the displayed results in real-time or upon user confirmation (e.g., clicking an ""Apply Filters"" button).

FR-5: The system shall display a message to the user if no properties match the selected filter criteria.

FR-6: The system shall allow users to clear all applied filters with a single action (e.g., a ""Clear Filters"" button).

NFR-1: The system shall apply the filter criteria to the search results in under 2 seconds for result sets of up to 1000 properties.

NFR-2: The filter options shall be presented in a clear and intuitive manner, with appropriate labels and input controls (e.g., sliders, dropdown menus, checkboxes).

NFR-3: The system shall adhere to accessibility guidelines (e.g., WCAG 2.1) to ensure that users with disabilities can effectively use the filtering functionality.
