","FR-1: The system shall allow users to stream music from their library on any supported device (e.g., phone, tablet, computer) after successful authentication.
FR-2: The system shall synchronize the user's music library across all connected devices within 5 minutes of any changes (e.g., adding, deleting, or modifying tracks).
FR-3: The system shall require users to log in with valid credentials (username/password or other authentication method) before accessing their music library.
FR-4: The system shall store and manage metadata associated with each music track, including title, artist, album, and genre.
FR-5: If a song is unavailable on a device due to licensing restrictions, the system shall display a message indicating the reason and suggest alternative tracks or artists.
FR-6: The system shall automatically back up user library data (metadata and playlists) daily to a secure cloud storage location.
NFR-1: Music playback shall start within 2 seconds of the user selecting a track, assuming a stable internet connection of at least 5 Mbps.
NFR-2: The user interface shall be consistent across all supported devices, providing a similar experience for browsing and playing music.
NFR-3: The system shall encrypt all music data transmitted between the user's device and the server using TLS 1.3 or higher.

Let's solve this requirement engineering task using a Reasoning-Action loop.

USER STORY:
As a music listener, I want to be able to access my music library across multiple devices, so that I can listen to my music wherever I am.

REASONING STEP 1:
Let's identify the core functionality requested in this user story. What is the primary action or outcome the user expects?

ACTION STEP 1:
FR-1: [Primary functional requirement based on the core need]
FR-2: [Secondary functional requirement that supports the core need]

REASONING STEP 2:
Now let's consider the triggers, conditions, and context for this functionality. What needs to happen before, during, and after the main function?

ACTION STEP 2:
FR-3: [Requirement related to preconditions or triggers]
FR-4: [Requirement related to process steps or data handling]

REASONING STEP 3:
We need to consider reliability, error conditions, and alternative paths. What happens when things don't work as expected?

ACTION STEP 3:
FR-5: [Requirement addressing error handling or alternative flows]
FR-6: [Requirement addressing backup functionality or notifications]
NFR-1: [Non-functional requirement related to performance or timing]

REASONING STEP 4:
Let's consider user experience, accessibility, and other quality attributes important for this feature.

ACTION STEP 4:
NFR-2: [Non-functional requirement related to user interface or experience]
NFR-3: [Non-functional requirement related to quality attributes like accessibility or security]

","FR-1: The system shall allow users to access their music library from at least three different device types (e.g., smartphone, tablet, computer) within 10 seconds of login.
FR-2: The system shall synchronize music library data (tracks, playlists, metadata) across all logged-in devices within 5 minutes of any change.
FR-3: The system shall require users to authenticate with a valid username and password before accessing their music library.
FR-4: The system shall store music library data (including but not limited to title, artist, album, and user-created playlists) in a cloud-based database.
FR-5: The system shall display an error message to the user if music library synchronization fails and automatically retry synchronization every 15 minutes.
FR-6: The system shall provide a notification to the user when music library synchronization is completed successfully on a new device.
NFR-1: Music playback shall start within 2 seconds of selection on any supported device, assuming a stable internet connection of at least 5 Mbps.
NFR-2: The user interface shall be responsive and adaptable to different screen sizes and orientations on supported devices.
NFR-3: The system shall encrypt all music library data both in transit and at rest using AES-256 encryption to protect user data.
