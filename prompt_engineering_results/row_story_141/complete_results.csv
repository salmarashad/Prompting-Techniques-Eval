","FR-1: The system shall allow the user to create, edit, and delete availability slots in their personal calendar.
FR-2: The system shall display the user's availability status (free/busy) to other users with appropriate permissions.
FR-3: The user must be authenticated and logged into the system before setting their availability.
FR-4: The system shall store the user's availability information, including start time, end time, and status (free/busy), in a persistent data store.
FR-5: The system shall display an error message to the user if there is a conflict with existing calendar entries when setting availability.
FR-6: The system shall send a notification to other users (if configured) when the user's availability changes significantly (e.g., a large block of time becomes unavailable).
NFR-1: The system shall update the user's availability status within 2 seconds of the user saving changes.
NFR-2: The user interface for setting availability shall be intuitive and easy to use, with clear visual cues indicating free and busy slots.
NFR-3: The system shall ensure that only authorized users can view a user's availability, adhering to privacy settings defined by the user.

Let's solve this requirement engineering task using a Reasoning-Action loop.

USER STORY:
As a user, I want to be able to set my availability in my personal calendar, so that others can see when I am free.

REASONING STEP 1:
Let's identify the core functionality requested in this user story. What is the primary action or outcome the user expects?

ACTION STEP 1:
FR-1: [Primary functional requirement based on the core need]
FR-2: [Secondary functional requirement that supports the core need]

REASONING STEP 2:
Now let's consider the triggers, conditions, and context for this functionality. What needs to happen before, during, and after the main function?

ACTION STEP 2:
FR-3: [Requirement related to preconditions or triggers]
FR-4: [Requirement related to process steps or data handling]

REASONING STEP 3:
We need to consider reliability, error conditions, and alternative paths. What happens when things don't work as expected?

ACTION STEP 3:
FR-5: [Requirement addressing error handling or alternative flows]
FR-6: [Requirement addressing backup functionality or notifications]
NFR-1: [Non-functional requirement related to performance or timing]

REASONING STEP 4:
Let's consider user experience, accessibility, and other quality attributes important for this feature.

ACTION STEP 4:
NFR-2: [Non-functional requirement related to user interface or experience]
NFR-3: [Non-functional requirement related to quality attributes like accessibility or security]

","FR-1: The system shall allow users to designate specific time slots in their personal calendar as ""available"" or ""unavailable"" for others to view.
FR-2: The system shall visually differentiate ""available"" and ""unavailable"" time slots within the user's calendar view.
FR-3: Users must be authenticated and logged into the system before they can set or modify their availability.
FR-4: The system shall store availability information with a granularity of at least 30-minute intervals.
FR-5: The system shall display an error message if the user attempts to set availability for a time slot that overlaps with an existing, conflicting appointment or another unavailability block.
FR-6: The system shall provide a confirmation message to the user after successfully setting or modifying their availability.
NFR-1: The system shall update the availability status for other users viewing the calendar within 5 seconds of the user saving the changes.
NFR-2: The calendar interface shall be intuitive and easy to navigate, allowing users to quickly set and modify their availability with minimal clicks.
NFR-3: The system shall adhere to WCAG 2.1 Level AA accessibility guidelines for color contrast and keyboard navigation for setting availability.
