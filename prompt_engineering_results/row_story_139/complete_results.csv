USER STORY:
As a user, I want to be able to create events in my personal calendar, so that I can keep track of my schedule.

REASONING STEP 1:
Let's identify the core functionality requested in this user story. What is the primary action or outcome the user expects?

ACTION STEP 1:
FR-1: [Primary functional requirement based on the core need]
FR-2: [Secondary functional requirement that supports the core need]

REASONING STEP 2:
Now let's consider the triggers, conditions, and context for this functionality. What needs to happen before, during, and after the main function?

ACTION STEP 2:
FR-3: [Requirement related to preconditions or triggers]
FR-4: [Requirement related to process steps or data handling]

REASONING STEP 3:
We need to consider reliability, error conditions, and alternative paths. What happens when things don't work as expected?

ACTION STEP 3:
FR-5: [Requirement addressing error handling or alternative flows]
FR-6: [Requirement addressing backup functionality or notifications]
NFR-1: [Non-functional requirement related to performance or timing]

REASONING STEP 4:
Let's consider user experience, accessibility, and other quality attributes important for this feature.

ACTION STEP 4:
NFR-2: [Non-functional requirement related to user interface or experience]
NFR-3: [Non-functional requirement related to quality attributes like accessibility or security]

FINAL REQUIREMENTS:
[Comprehensive list of all requirements developed through the reasoning-action process]

I want you to only share the specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound functional (FR) and nonfunctional (NFR) requirements as follows and do not share your reasoning with me: :

","FR-1: The system shall allow the user to create a new event in their calendar with a title, start date/time, and end date/time.
FR-2: The system shall store the event details (title, start date/time, end date/time) associated with the user's account.
FR-3: The user must be logged in to the system before creating an event.
FR-4: The system shall validate that the end date/time is after the start date/time before saving the event.
FR-5: The system shall display an error message to the user if the event creation fails, specifying the reason for the failure.
FR-6: The system shall provide a notification to the user 15 minutes before the event's start time (configurable by the user).
NFR-1: The system shall create a new event within 2 seconds of the user submitting the event details.
NFR-2: The user interface for creating an event shall be intuitive and easy to use, with clear labels and instructions.
NFR-3: The system shall ensure that event data is only accessible to the user who created the event.
