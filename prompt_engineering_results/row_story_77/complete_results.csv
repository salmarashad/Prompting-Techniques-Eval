As a contractor, I want to be able to share my progress and status with my clients, so that they can see the value I am delivering and trust that I am meeting their expectations.

Follow these steps to derive the requirements:

1. Identify the actor (Who is performing the action?)
   - Who is the primary user in this story?
   - What is their role in the system?

2. Identify the action (What do they want to do?)
   - What specific functionality is being requested?
   - What system components would be involved?

3. Identify the goal (Why do they want to do it?)
   - What is the underlying user need?
   - How does this relate to business objectives?

4. Extract assumptions and constraints
   - What implicit needs are not directly stated?
   - What technical or business constraints might apply?

5. Derive detailed functional requirements (FR) from the analysis performed in the previous steps.
   - What specific behaviors must the system exhibit?
   - What are the inputs, processes, and outputs?

6. Derive non-functional requirements (NFR) from the analysis performed in the previous steps.
   - What quality attributes are important (performance, security, usability)?
   - What measurable criteria should apply?

Based on the analysis performed in the steps above, provide a numbered list of clear, specific, and testable functional (FR) and non-functional (NFR) requirements.

Output ONLY the functional (FR) and non-functional (NFR) requirements in the following format and do not share your reasoning with me:

Let's solve this requirement engineering task using a Reasoning-Action loop.

USER STORY:
As a contractor, I want to be able to share my progress and status with my clients, so that they can see the value I am delivering and trust that I am meeting their expectations.

REASONING STEP 1:
Let's identify the core functionality requested in this user story. What is the primary action or outcome the user expects?

ACTION STEP 1:
FR-1: [Primary functional requirement based on the core need]
FR-2: [Secondary functional requirement that supports the core need]

REASONING STEP 2:
Now let's consider the triggers, conditions, and context for this functionality. What needs to happen before, during, and after the main function?

ACTION STEP 2:
FR-3: [Requirement related to preconditions or triggers]
FR-4: [Requirement related to process steps or data handling]

REASONING STEP 3:
We need to consider reliability, error conditions, and alternative paths. What happens when things don't work as expected?

ACTION STEP 3:
FR-5: [Requirement addressing error handling or alternative flows]
FR-6: [Requirement addressing backup functionality or notifications]
NFR-1: [Non-functional requirement related to performance or timing]

REASONING STEP 4:
Let's consider user experience, accessibility, and other quality attributes important for this feature.

ACTION STEP 4:
NFR-2: [Non-functional requirement related to user interface or experience]
NFR-3: [Non-functional requirement related to quality attributes like accessibility or security]

","FR-1: The system shall allow contractors to create and share progress updates with clients.
FR-2: The system shall provide a mechanism for clients to view progress updates shared by the contractor.
FR-3: The system shall require contractors to authenticate their identity before creating and sharing updates.
FR-4: The system shall store all progress updates with a timestamp and associated contractor and client identifiers.
FR-5: The system shall provide an error message to the contractor if a progress update fails to save.
FR-6: The system shall send an email notification to the client when a new progress update is shared by the contractor.
NFR-1: The system shall display progress updates within 3 seconds of a client's request.
NFR-2: The user interface for creating and viewing progress updates shall be intuitive and easy to navigate, conforming to WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility standards.
NFR-3: The system shall encrypt all progress update data at rest and in transit to protect client confidentiality.
