Let's solve this requirement engineering task using a Reasoning-Action loop.

USER STORY:
As a user, I want to be able to save news articles for later reading.

REASONING STEP 1:
Let's identify the core functionality requested in this user story. What is the primary action or outcome the user expects?

ACTION STEP 1:
FR-1: [Primary functional requirement based on the core need]
FR-2: [Secondary functional requirement that supports the core need]

REASONING STEP 2:
Now let's consider the triggers, conditions, and context for this functionality. What needs to happen before, during, and after the main function?

ACTION STEP 2:
FR-3: [Requirement related to preconditions or triggers]
FR-4: [Requirement related to process steps or data handling]

REASONING STEP 3:
We need to consider reliability, error conditions, and alternative paths. What happens when things don't work as expected?

ACTION STEP 3:
FR-5: [Requirement addressing error handling or alternative flows]
FR-6: [Requirement addressing backup functionality or notifications]
NFR-1: [Non-functional requirement related to performance or timing]

REASONING STEP 4:
Let's consider user experience, accessibility, and other quality attributes important for this feature.

ACTION STEP 4:
NFR-2: [Non-functional requirement related to user interface or experience]
NFR-3: [Non-functional requirement related to quality attributes like accessibility or security]

FINAL REQUIREMENTS:
[Comprehensive list of all requirements developed through the reasoning-action process]

I want you to only share the specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound functional (FR) and nonfunctional (NFR) requirements as follows and do not share your reasoning with me: :

","FR-1: The system shall provide a ""Save"" button or similar UI element on each news article page.
FR-2: The system shall store the saved news articles associated with the user's account.
FR-3: The user must be logged in to the system to save an article.
FR-4: The system shall store the article title, URL, publication date, and a short excerpt (if available) when an article is saved.
FR-5: If the user attempts to save an article without being logged in, the system shall display a message prompting them to log in or create an account.
FR-6: The system shall provide a mechanism to allow the user to delete saved articles.
NFR-1: Saving an article should take no longer than 2 seconds.
NFR-2: The user should be able to access their saved articles through a clearly labeled ""Saved Articles"" section in the user interface.
NFR-3: The saved articles should be stored securely and accessible only to the authenticated user.
