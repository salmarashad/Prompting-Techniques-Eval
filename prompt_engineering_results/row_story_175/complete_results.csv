Let's solve this requirement engineering task using a Reasoning-Action loop.

USER STORY:
As a user, I want to be able to easily cancel or modify my order if necessary.

REASONING STEP 1:
Let's identify the core functionality requested in this user story. What is the primary action or outcome the user expects?

ACTION STEP 1:
FR-1: [Primary functional requirement based on the core need]
FR-2: [Secondary functional requirement that supports the core need]

REASONING STEP 2:
Now let's consider the triggers, conditions, and context for this functionality. What needs to happen before, during, and after the main function?

ACTION STEP 2:
FR-3: [Requirement related to preconditions or triggers]
FR-4: [Requirement related to process steps or data handling]

REASONING STEP 3:
We need to consider reliability, error conditions, and alternative paths. What happens when things don't work as expected?

ACTION STEP 3:
FR-5: [Requirement addressing error handling or alternative flows]
FR-6: [Requirement addressing backup functionality or notifications]
NFR-1: [Non-functional requirement related to performance or timing]

REASONING STEP 4:
Let's consider user experience, accessibility, and other quality attributes important for this feature.

ACTION STEP 4:
NFR-2: [Non-functional requirement related to user interface or experience]
NFR-3: [Non-functional requirement related to quality attributes like accessibility or security]

FINAL REQUIREMENTS:
[Comprehensive list of all requirements developed through the reasoning-action process]

I want you to only share the specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound functional (FR) and nonfunctional (NFR) requirements as follows and do not share your reasoning with me: :

and so on..
","FR-1: The system shall allow users to cancel an order within 60 minutes of order placement.
FR-2: The system shall allow users to modify the shipping address and payment method of an order before it is marked as ""shipped.""
FR-3: The system shall require users to authenticate their identity (via password or multi-factor authentication) before allowing cancellation or modification of an order.
FR-4: Upon cancellation, the system shall immediately initiate a full refund to the original payment method and send a confirmation email to the user.
FR-5: If the system fails to initiate a refund automatically, it shall generate an alert for the administrator to manually process the refund within 24 hours.
FR-6: The system shall send a notification to the user confirming the cancellation or modification request and its status (e.g., ""pending,"" ""processed,"" ""failed"").
NFR-1: The cancellation or modification process shall be completed within 5 seconds.
NFR-2: The cancellation and modification options shall be easily accessible from the user's order history page, with clear and intuitive UI elements.
NFR-3: The system shall protect user payment information during modification requests, adhering to PCI DSS compliance standards.
