Let's solve this requirement engineering task using a Reasoning-Action loop.

USER STORY:
As a project manager, I want to be able to track project progress online so that I can ensure that the project is on track.

REASONING STEP 1:
Let's identify the core functionality requested in this user story. What is the primary action or outcome the user expects?

ACTION STEP 1:
FR-1: [Primary functional requirement based on the core need]
FR-2: [Secondary functional requirement that supports the core need]

REASONING STEP 2:
Now let's consider the triggers, conditions, and context for this functionality. What needs to happen before, during, and after the main function?

ACTION STEP 2:
FR-3: [Requirement related to preconditions or triggers]
FR-4: [Requirement related to process steps or data handling]

REASONING STEP 3:
We need to consider reliability, error conditions, and alternative paths. What happens when things don't work as expected?

ACTION STEP 3:
FR-5: [Requirement addressing error handling or alternative flows]
FR-6: [Requirement addressing backup functionality or notifications]
NFR-1: [Non-functional requirement related to performance or timing]

REASONING STEP 4:
Let's consider user experience, accessibility, and other quality attributes important for this feature.

ACTION STEP 4:
NFR-2: [Non-functional requirement related to user interface or experience]
NFR-3: [Non-functional requirement related to quality attributes like accessibility or security]

FINAL REQUIREMENTS:
[Comprehensive list of all requirements developed through the reasoning-action process]

I want you to only share the specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound functional (FR) and nonfunctional (NFR) requirements as follows and do not share your reasoning with me: :

and so on..
","FR-1: The system shall display project progress as a percentage complete, updated in real-time based on task completion.
FR-2: The system shall allow the project manager to view a Gantt chart representation of the project schedule, showing task dependencies and timelines.
FR-3: The system shall require the project manager to log in with valid credentials before accessing project progress information.
FR-4: The system shall store and update task completion status upon receiving input from team members via a task management interface.
FR-5: If the system fails to update project progress within 5 seconds, it shall display an error message to the project manager and automatically retry the update.
FR-6: The system shall send a daily email summary to the project manager, outlining the project's overall progress and highlighting any tasks that are behind schedule.
NFR-1: The project progress dashboard shall load within 3 seconds.
NFR-2: The user interface for tracking project progress shall be intuitive and easy to navigate, adhering to WCAG 2.1 Level AA accessibility standards.
NFR-3: The system shall use HTTPS to encrypt all data transmitted between the client and server to ensure data confidentiality.
