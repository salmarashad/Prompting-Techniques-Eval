ACTION STEP 2:
FR-3: [Requirement related to preconditions or triggers]
FR-4: [Requirement related to process steps or data handling]

REASONING STEP 3:
We need to consider reliability, error conditions, and alternative paths. What happens when things don't work as expected?

ACTION STEP 3:
FR-5: [Requirement addressing error handling or alternative flows]
FR-6: [Requirement addressing backup functionality or notifications]
NFR-1: [Non-functional requirement related to performance or timing]

REASONING STEP 4:
Let's consider user experience, accessibility, and other quality attributes important for this feature.

ACTION STEP 4:
NFR-2: [Non-functional requirement related to user interface or experience]
NFR-3: [Non-functional requirement related to quality attributes like accessibility or security]

FINAL REQUIREMENTS:
[Comprehensive list of all requirements developed through the reasoning-action process]

I want you to only share the specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound functional (FR) and nonfunctional (NFR) requirements as follows and do not share your reasoning with me: :

and so on..
","FR-1: The system shall allow users to add external calendars (e.g., Google Calendar, Outlook Calendar, iCalendar) via a valid calendar URL or authenticated connection.

FR-5: The system shall display an error message to the user if synchronization fails for an external calendar and attempt to re-sync automatically after 1 hour.
FR-6: The system shall notify the user via in-app notification if an external calendar consistently fails to synchronize for more than 72 hours.
NFR-1: Calendar synchronization shall complete within 5 minutes for calendars with fewer than 1000 events.
NFR-2: The unified calendar view shall clearly distinguish events from different calendars, using color-coding or other visual cues.
NFR-3: The system shall protect user calendar data by using secure connections (HTTPS) for all communication with external calendar services and adhering to relevant privacy standards (e.g., GDPR, CCPA).
