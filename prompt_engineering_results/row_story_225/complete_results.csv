**User Story:** As a user, I want to be able to find healthy recipes that fit my dietary restrictions so that I can maintain a healthy diet.

**Requirements:**

**Functional Requirements (FR):**

*   **FR-1:** The system shall provide a search interface allowing users to specify dietary restrictions, including but not limited to: vegetarian, vegan, gluten-free, dairy-free, nut-free, soy-free, and pescatarian.
*   **FR-2:** The system shall allow users to specify multiple dietary restrictions simultaneously.
*   **FR-3:** The system shall allow users to specify ingredients they want to include or exclude.
*   **FR-4:** The system shall display search results as a list of recipes, including at a minimum: recipe title, brief description, and a thumbnail image.
*   **FR-5:** The system shall provide a detailed view for each recipe, including: a full list of ingredients, step-by-step instructions, nutritional information (calories, fat, protein, carbohydrates), preparation time, and cooking time.
*   **FR-6:** The system shall allow users to save recipes to a personal collection (e.g., ""Favorites"").
*   **FR-7:** The system shall indicate which recipes match the user’s specified dietary restrictions clearly in the search results and detailed recipe view.
*   **FR-8:** The system shall provide a ""healthy"" filter with options such as ""low-fat,"" ""low-sodium,"" ""high-protein,"" and ""low-sugar"" to further refine the search.

**Non-Functional Requirements (NFR):**

*   **NFR-1:** The search results shall be displayed within 3 seconds of the user initiating a search.
*   **NFR-2:** The system shall maintain a database of at least 500 unique recipes that comply with common dietary restrictions within the first month of launch.
*   **NFR-3:** The system shall ensure that the accuracy of nutritional information for each recipe is within +/- 5% of the stated values, verified through a trusted data source.
*   **NFR-4:** The system shall be accessible and responsive on mobile devices (smartphones and tablets) with varying screen sizes.
*   **NFR-5:** The system shall be able to handle at least 100 concurrent users searching for recipes without significant performance degradation (response time exceeding 5 seconds).
*   **NFR-6:** The system shall be accessible in the english language.

**Explanation of Choices:**

*   **Specific:** Each requirement is focused and clearly defined.  There's no ambiguity about what is required.
*   **Measurable:**  The NFRs include specific metrics (e.g., ""3 seconds"", ""500 unique recipes"", ""+/- 5%"").  The FRs implicitly measurable by their existence (e.g., does the system *have* a search interface that allows dietary restrictions?).
*   **Achievable:**  The requirements are realistic given typical software development capabilities.
*   **Relevant:**  All requirements directly support the user's goal of finding healthy recipes that fit their dietary needs.
*   **Time-bound:** NFR-2 implicitly includes a deadline. Further NFRs could include deadlines.

This breakdown provides a clear and actionable set of requirements for the development team. Remember that these are just examples, and more requirements could be added as the project progresses.

Let's solve this requirement engineering task using a Reasoning-Action loop.

USER STORY:
As a user, I want to be able to find healthy recipes that fit my dietary restrictions so that I can maintain a healthy diet.

REASONING STEP 1:
Let's identify the core functionality requested in this user story. What is the primary action or outcome the user expects?

ACTION STEP 1:
FR-1: [Primary functional requirement based on the core need]
FR-2: [Secondary functional requirement that supports the core need]

REASONING STEP 2:
Now let's consider the triggers, conditions, and context for this functionality. What needs to happen before, during, and after the main function?

ACTION STEP 2:
FR-3: [Requirement related to preconditions or triggers]
FR-4: [Requirement related to process steps or data handling]

REASONING STEP 3:
We need to consider reliability, error conditions, and alternative paths. What happens when things don't work as expected?

ACTION STEP 3:
FR-5: [Requirement addressing error handling or alternative flows]
FR-6: [Requirement addressing backup functionality or notifications]
NFR-1: [Non-functional requirement related to performance or timing]

REASONING STEP 4:
Let's consider user experience, accessibility, and other quality attributes important for this feature.

ACTION STEP 4:
NFR-2: [Non-functional requirement related to user interface or experience]
NFR-3: [Non-functional requirement related to quality attributes like accessibility or security]

FINAL REQUIREMENTS:
[Comprehensive list of all requirements developed through the reasoning-action process]

I want you to only share the specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound functional (FR) and nonfunctional (NFR) requirements as follows and do not share your reasoning with me: :

","FR-1: The system shall provide a search function that allows users to search for recipes based on keywords, ingredients, and dietary restrictions.
FR-2: The system shall display a list of recipes matching the user's search criteria, including recipe title, a brief description, and a thumbnail image.
FR-3: The system shall require users to optionally specify their dietary restrictions (e.g., vegetarian, vegan, gluten-free, dairy-free, nut-free) before initiating a recipe search.
FR-4: The system shall store and associate dietary restrictions with each recipe in a database.
FR-5: If no recipes match the user's search criteria, the system shall display a message indicating that no results were found and suggest alternative search terms or dietary restriction adjustments.
FR-6: The system shall notify the user if the recipe data is unavailable or temporarily inaccessible due to system maintenance.
NFR-1: The system shall return search results within 3 seconds.
NFR-2: The system shall provide a user-friendly interface with clear and concise instructions for searching and filtering recipes.
NFR-3: The system shall be accessible to users with visual impairments, adhering to WCAG 2.1 Level AA guidelines.
