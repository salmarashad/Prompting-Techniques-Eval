Let's solve this requirement engineering task using a Reasoning-Action loop.

USER STORY:
As an instructor, I want to be able to provide video lectures so that I can engage students and deliver content in a dynamic way.

REASONING STEP 1:
Let's identify the core functionality requested in this user story. What is the primary action or outcome the user expects?

ACTION STEP 1:
FR-1: [Primary functional requirement based on the core need]
FR-2: [Secondary functional requirement that supports the core need]

REASONING STEP 2:
Now let's consider the triggers, conditions, and context for this functionality. What needs to happen before, during, and after the main function?

ACTION STEP 2:
FR-3: [Requirement related to preconditions or triggers]
FR-4: [Requirement related to process steps or data handling]

REASONING STEP 3:
We need to consider reliability, error conditions, and alternative paths. What happens when things don't work as expected?

ACTION STEP 3:
FR-5: [Requirement addressing error handling or alternative flows]
FR-6: [Requirement addressing backup functionality or notifications]
NFR-1: [Non-functional requirement related to performance or timing]

REASONING STEP 4:
Let's consider user experience, accessibility, and other quality attributes important for this feature.

ACTION STEP 4:
NFR-2: [Non-functional requirement related to user interface or experience]
NFR-3: [Non-functional requirement related to quality attributes like accessibility or security]

FINAL REQUIREMENTS:
[Comprehensive list of all requirements developed through the reasoning-action process]

I want you to only share the specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound functional (FR) and nonfunctional (NFR) requirements as follows and do not share your reasoning with me: :

and so on..
","FR-1: The system shall allow instructors to upload video lectures in common video formats (e.g., MP4, AVI, MOV).
FR-2: The system shall store and manage uploaded video lectures, associating them with the correct course and module.
FR-3: Instructors must authenticate with valid credentials before uploading a video lecture.
FR-4: The system shall automatically transcode uploaded videos to ensure compatibility across different devices and bandwidths.
FR-5: The system shall display an error message to the instructor if a video upload fails, including the reason for failure (e.g., file size limit exceeded, invalid format).
FR-6: The system shall send an email notification to the instructor upon successful processing of their video upload.
NFR-1: The system shall transcode uploaded videos within 30 minutes.
NFR-2: The video player shall be responsive and provide controls for playback, pause, volume, and fullscreen.
NFR-3: The video lectures shall be accessible to students with disabilities, adhering to WCAG 2.1 Level AA guidelines, including providing closed captions.
