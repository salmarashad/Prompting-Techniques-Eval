*   **FR-6: Calorie Goal Setting:** The system shall allow users to set a daily calorie goal.
*   **FR-7: Goal Tracking:** The system shall display a comparison of the user's daily calorie intake against their set goal. It should show:
    *   Whether the user is over or under their calorie goal.
    *   The number of calories remaining or exceeded.
*   **FR-8: Meal History:** The system shall store a history of meals logged by the user.
*   **FR-9: Historical Reporting:** The system shall allow users to view their meal history for previous days, weeks, or months.
*   **FR-10: Data Persistence:** The system shall save meal entries entered by the user, even when the application is closed.

**Non-Functional Requirements (NFR)**

*   **NFR-1: Database Size:** The food database shall contain information for at least 10,000 food items initially.

*   **Search Performance:** Fast search is key to a good user experience.
*   **Responsiveness:**  Users need quick feedback from the application to feel like it's working properly.
*   **Platform Compatibility:** Defining platform support is critical.
*   **Data Security:**  Protecting user's personal meal data is paramount.
*   **Scalability and Availability:** Important considerations when the system expects a significant number of concurrent users or a high availability requirement.
*   **Data Persistence:** The system needs to store the data the user has input so they can track their progress.

These requirements are now more concrete, measurable, and provide a much clearer understanding of what needs to be built and tested. Each requirement is specific, has an implicit or explicit metric, and is time-bound through the development lifecycle.

Convert the following user story into specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound software requirements by following these steps:

USER STORY:
As a user, I want to be able to track my meals so that I can monitor my daily calorie intake.

Follow these steps to derive the requirements:

1. Identify the actor (Who is performing the action?)
   - Who is the primary user in this story?
   - What is their role in the system?

2. Identify the action (What do they want to do?)
   - What specific functionality is being requested?
   - What system components would be involved?

3. Identify the goal (Why do they want to do it?)
   - What is the underlying user need?
   - How does this relate to business objectives?

4. Extract assumptions and constraints
   - What implicit needs are not directly stated?
   - What technical or business constraints might apply?

5. Derive detailed functional requirements (FR) from the analysis performed in the previous steps.
   - What specific behaviors must the system exhibit?
   - What are the inputs, processes, and outputs?

6. Derive non-functional requirements (NFR) from the analysis performed in the previous steps.
   - What quality attributes are important (performance, security, usability)?
   - What measurable criteria should apply?

Based on the analysis performed in the steps above, provide a numbered list of clear, specific, and testable functional (FR) and non-functional (NFR) requirements.

Let's solve this requirement engineering task using a Reasoning-Action loop.

USER STORY:
As a user, I want to be able to track my meals so that I can monitor my daily calorie intake.

REASONING STEP 1:
Let's identify the core functionality requested in this user story. What is the primary action or outcome the user expects?

ACTION STEP 1:
FR-1: [Primary functional requirement based on the core need]
FR-2: [Secondary functional requirement that supports the core need]

REASONING STEP 2:
Now let's consider the triggers, conditions, and context for this functionality. What needs to happen before, during, and after the main function?

ACTION STEP 2:
FR-3: [Requirement related to preconditions or triggers]
FR-4: [Requirement related to process steps or data handling]

REASONING STEP 3:
We need to consider reliability, error conditions, and alternative paths. What happens when things don't work as expected?

ACTION STEP 3:
FR-5: [Requirement addressing error handling or alternative flows]
FR-6: [Requirement addressing backup functionality or notifications]
NFR-1: [Non-functional requirement related to performance or timing]

REASONING STEP 4:

ACTION STEP 4:
NFR-2: [Non-functional requirement related to user interface or experience]
NFR-3: [Non-functional requirement related to quality attributes like accessibility or security]
