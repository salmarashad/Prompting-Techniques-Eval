Let's solve this requirement engineering task using a Reasoning-Action loop.

USER STORY:
As a user, I want to be able to report any issues with the parking spot or payment process.

REASONING STEP 1:
Let's identify the core functionality requested in this user story. What is the primary action or outcome the user expects?

ACTION STEP 1:
FR-1: [Primary functional requirement based on the core need]
FR-2: [Secondary functional requirement that supports the core need]

REASONING STEP 2:
Now let's consider the triggers, conditions, and context for this functionality. What needs to happen before, during, and after the main function?

ACTION STEP 2:
FR-3: [Requirement related to preconditions or triggers]
FR-4: [Requirement related to process steps or data handling]

REASONING STEP 3:
We need to consider reliability, error conditions, and alternative paths. What happens when things don't work as expected?

ACTION STEP 3:
FR-5: [Requirement addressing error handling or alternative flows]
FR-6: [Requirement addressing backup functionality or notifications]
NFR-1: [Non-functional requirement related to performance or timing]

REASONING STEP 4:
Let's consider user experience, accessibility, and other quality attributes important for this feature.

ACTION STEP 4:
NFR-2: [Non-functional requirement related to user interface or experience]
NFR-3: [Non-functional requirement related to quality attributes like accessibility or security]

FINAL REQUIREMENTS:

","FR-1: The system shall allow users to submit reports regarding issues with parking spots (e.g., occupied, damaged) or the payment process.
FR-2: The system shall provide a form or interface for users to input details about the issue, including a description and location (if applicable).
FR-3: The user must be logged in or provide sufficient identification (e.g., parking ticket number) to submit a report.
FR-4: The system shall record the date, time, and user identification associated with each submitted report.
FR-5: The system shall display a confirmation message to the user upon successful submission of the report, including a unique report identifier.
FR-6: The system shall notify relevant personnel (e.g., parking management, support team) about the submitted report within 5 minutes of submission.
NFR-1: The report submission process shall be completed within 3 seconds under normal operating conditions.
NFR-2: The report submission form shall be accessible and easy to use on both desktop and mobile devices.
NFR-3: The system shall protect user data and report details in compliance with relevant data privacy regulations (e.g., GDPR, CCPA).
