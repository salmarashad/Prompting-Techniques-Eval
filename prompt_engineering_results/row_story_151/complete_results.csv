Let's solve this requirement engineering task using a Reasoning-Action loop.

USER STORY:
As a user, I want to be able to view and track my investment performance over time so that I can evaluate my strategies and make informed decisions.

REASONING STEP 1:
Let's identify the core functionality requested in this user story. What is the primary action or outcome the user expects?

ACTION STEP 1:
FR-1: [Primary functional requirement based on the core need]
FR-2: [Secondary functional requirement that supports the core need]

REASONING STEP 2:
Now let's consider the triggers, conditions, and context for this functionality. What needs to happen before, during, and after the main function?

ACTION STEP 2:
FR-3: [Requirement related to preconditions or triggers]
FR-4: [Requirement related to process steps or data handling]

REASONING STEP 3:
We need to consider reliability, error conditions, and alternative paths. What happens when things don't work as expected?

ACTION STEP 3:
FR-5: [Requirement addressing error handling or alternative flows]
FR-6: [Requirement addressing backup functionality or notifications]
NFR-1: [Non-functional requirement related to performance or timing]

REASONING STEP 4:
Let's consider user experience, accessibility, and other quality attributes important for this feature.

ACTION STEP 4:
NFR-2: [Non-functional requirement related to user interface or experience]
NFR-3: [Non-functional requirement related to quality attributes like accessibility or security]

FINAL REQUIREMENTS:
[Comprehensive list of all requirements developed through the reasoning-action process]

I want you to only share the specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound functional (FR) and nonfunctional (NFR) requirements as follows and do not share your reasoning with me: :

and so on..
","FR-1: The system shall display a chart visualizing the user's investment portfolio value over a selectable time period (e.g., 1 day, 1 week, 1 month, 1 year, custom range).

FR-2: The system shall allow the user to filter the performance view by investment asset type (e.g., stocks, bonds, mutual funds, crypto).

FR-3: The system shall require the user to be authenticated and have an existing investment portfolio before displaying the performance data.

FR-4: The system shall calculate investment performance based on transaction history (buys, sells, dividends, fees) and market data, updated daily at 6:00 PM EST.

FR-5: If the system cannot retrieve market data, it shall display an error message to the user indicating the data source is unavailable and display the last available data.

FR-6: The system shall automatically generate and send a monthly performance report to the user's registered email address.

NFR-1: The investment performance chart shall load within 3 seconds.

NFR-2: The investment performance chart and related data displays shall be accessible and compliant with WCAG 2.1 Level AA guidelines.

NFR-3: All investment performance data shall be encrypted both in transit and at rest, adhering to industry best practices for financial data security.
