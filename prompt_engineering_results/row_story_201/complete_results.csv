","Okay, here's the breakdown of the user story ""As a user, I want to connect with friends and other users so that I can stay motivated and share my progress"" into specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound functional and non-functional requirements:

**Functional Requirements (FR):**

*   **FR-1: User Search and Discovery:** The system shall allow users to search for other users by name, username, or email address.
*   **FR-2: Friend Request Mechanism:** The system shall allow users to send and receive friend requests.

*   **FR-9: Direct Messaging (Optional):** The system shall allow users to send direct messages to their friends.
*   **FR-10: Group Creation (Optional):** The system shall allow users to create and join groups based on shared interests or goals.

**Non-Functional Requirements (NFR):**

*   **NFR-1: Friend Request Response Time:** The system shall process friend requests (accept/decline) within 2 seconds.
*   **NFR-2: Search Performance:** The system shall return search results for users within 3 seconds.
*   **NFR-3: Activity Feed Load Time:** The activity feed shall load the latest 20 updates within 4 seconds.

**Explanation of Choices and Considerations:**

*   **Functional Requirements:** These define *what* the system needs to do to fulfill the user's desire to connect and share.  I've broken it down into smaller, more manageable pieces.  The ""Optional"" FRs are features that would enhance the experience but aren't strictly required for the core functionality.
*   **Non-Functional Requirements:** These define *how well* the system needs to perform.  They focus on performance, security, scalability, and usability.  The specific values (e.g., 2 seconds, 99.9%) are examples and should be adjusted based on the specific needs and resources of the project.
*   **Measurable:** Each requirement includes a measurable aspect (e.g., time, number of users, percentage of availability).
*   **Achievable:** The requirements are realistic given typical software development capabilities.
*   **Relevant:** The requirements directly address the user's need to connect with friends and share progress.
*   **Time-Bound:** The performance requirements include time constraints (e.g., response times).
*   **Security:** I've included a security NFR to emphasize the importance of protecting user data and privacy.
*   **Scalability:** The scalability NFR ensures the system can handle a reasonable number of users.

This breakdown provides a solid foundation for developing the features described in the user story. Remember to refine these requirements further based on specific project needs and constraints.

Convert the following user story into specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound software requirements by following these steps:

USER STORY:
As a user, I want to connect with friends and other users so that I can stay motivated and share my progress.

Follow these steps to derive the requirements:

1. Identify the actor (Who is performing the action?)
   - Who is the primary user in this story?
   - What is their role in the system?

2. Identify the action (What do they want to do?)
   - What specific functionality is being requested?
   - What system components would be involved?

3. Identify the goal (Why do they want to do it?)
   - What is the underlying user need?
   - How does this relate to business objectives?

4. Extract assumptions and constraints
   - What implicit needs are not directly stated?
   - What technical or business constraints might apply?

5. Derive detailed functional requirements (FR) from the analysis performed in the previous steps.
   - What specific behaviors must the system exhibit?
   - What are the inputs, processes, and outputs?

6. Derive non-functional requirements (NFR) from the analysis performed in the previous steps.
   - What quality attributes are important (performance, security, usability)?
   - What measurable criteria should apply?

Based on the analysis performed in the steps above, provide a numbered list of clear, specific, and testable functional (FR) and non-functional (NFR) requirements.

Let's solve this requirement engineering task using a Reasoning-Action loop.

USER STORY:
As a user, I want to connect with friends and other users so that I can stay motivated and share my progress.

REASONING STEP 1:
Let's identify the core functionality requested in this user story. What is the primary action or outcome the user expects?

ACTION STEP 1:
FR-1: [Primary functional requirement based on the core need]
FR-2: [Secondary functional requirement that supports the core need]

REASONING STEP 2:
Now let's consider the triggers, conditions, and context for this functionality. What needs to happen before, during, and after the main function?

ACTION STEP 2:
FR-3: [Requirement related to preconditions or triggers]
FR-4: [Requirement related to process steps or data handling]

REASONING STEP 3:
We need to consider reliability, error conditions, and alternative paths. What happens when things don't work as expected?

ACTION STEP 3:
FR-5: [Requirement addressing error handling or alternative flows]
FR-6: [Requirement addressing backup functionality or notifications]
NFR-1: [Non-functional requirement related to performance or timing]

REASONING STEP 4:
Let's consider user experience, accessibility, and other quality attributes important for this feature.

ACTION STEP 4:
NFR-2: [Non-functional requirement related to user interface or experience]
NFR-3: [Non-functional requirement related to quality attributes like accessibility or security]

FINAL REQUIREMENTS:

","FR-1: The system shall allow users to add other users as ""friends"" or ""connections"" through a search functionality and request mechanism.
FR-2: The system shall display a list of a user's ""friends"" or ""connections"" in a designated section of their profile.
FR-3: The system shall require users to have an active account and be logged in to connect with other users.
FR-4: The system shall provide a mechanism for users to accept or reject friend requests.
FR-5: The system shall display an error message if a user attempts to add a non-existent user as a friend.
FR-6: The system shall notify users via in-app notification and/or email when they receive a new friend request.
NFR-1: The system shall process friend requests within 2 seconds of submission.
NFR-2: The ""friends"" or ""connections"" list shall be easily accessible and navigable on both desktop and mobile devices.
NFR-3: The system shall ensure that user connections are private and only visible to the connected users unless the user explicitly configures their privacy settings otherwise.
