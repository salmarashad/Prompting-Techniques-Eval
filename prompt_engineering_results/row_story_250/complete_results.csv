*   **Completeness:** The requirements cover a range of aspects, including data content, filtering, exporting, performance, security, and scalability.
*   **Privacy:** The optional FR-8 addresses potential privacy concerns related to student data.  This is a crucial consideration in educational systems.
*   **Scalability:** NFR-5 explicitly addresses the need for the reporting system to scale as the number of students and courses grows. This is essential for long-term usability.
*   **Data Retention:** NFR-6 ensures that historical data is available for generating reports over time, which is important for tracking trends and making informed decisions.

As an administrator, I want to be able to generate reports on student and course performance so that I can evaluate the effectiveness of the system and make data-driven decisions.

Follow these steps to derive the requirements:

1. Identify the actor (Who is performing the action?)
   - Who is the primary user in this story?
   - What is their role in the system?

2. Identify the action (What do they want to do?)
   - What specific functionality is being requested?
   - What system components would be involved?

3. Identify the goal (Why do they want to do it?)
   - What is the underlying user need?
   - How does this relate to business objectives?

4. Extract assumptions and constraints
   - What implicit needs are not directly stated?
   - What technical or business constraints might apply?

5. Derive detailed functional requirements (FR) from the analysis performed in the previous steps.
   - What specific behaviors must the system exhibit?
   - What are the inputs, processes, and outputs?

6. Derive non-functional requirements (NFR) from the analysis performed in the previous steps.
   - What quality attributes are important (performance, security, usability)?
   - What measurable criteria should apply?

Based on the analysis performed in the steps above, provide a numbered list of clear, specific, and testable functional (FR) and non-functional (NFR) requirements.

Let's solve this requirement engineering task using a Reasoning-Action loop.

USER STORY:
As an administrator, I want to be able to generate reports on student and course performance so that I can evaluate the effectiveness of the system and make data-driven decisions.

REASONING STEP 1:
Let's identify the core functionality requested in this user story. What is the primary action or outcome the user expects?

ACTION STEP 1:
FR-1: [Primary functional requirement based on the core need]
FR-2: [Secondary functional requirement that supports the core need]

REASONING STEP 2:
Now let's consider the triggers, conditions, and context for this functionality. What needs to happen before, during, and after the main function?

ACTION STEP 2:
FR-3: [Requirement related to preconditions or triggers]
FR-4: [Requirement related to process steps or data handling]

REASONING STEP 3:
We need to consider reliability, error conditions, and alternative paths. What happens when things don't work as expected?

ACTION STEP 3:
FR-5: [Requirement addressing error handling or alternative flows]
FR-6: [Requirement addressing backup functionality or notifications]
NFR-1: [Non-functional requirement related to performance or timing]

REASONING STEP 4:
Let's consider user experience, accessibility, and other quality attributes important for this feature.

ACTION STEP 4:
NFR-2: [Non-functional requirement related to user interface or experience]
NFR-3: [Non-functional requirement related to quality attributes like accessibility or security]

FINAL REQUIREMENTS:
[Comprehensive list of all requirements developed through the reasoning-action process]

I want you to only share the specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound functional (FR) and nonfunctional (NFR) requirements as follows and do not share your reasoning with me: :

and so on..
","FR-1: The system shall allow administrators to generate reports on student and course performance, including metrics such as average grades, completion rates, and enrollment numbers.
FR-2: The system shall provide filtering options for reports, allowing administrators to specify date ranges, courses, and student groups.
FR-3: The system shall require administrator authentication and authorization before allowing access to report generation functionality.
FR-4: The system shall store report generation requests in a log, including the administrator ID, date, time, and filter criteria.
FR-5: The system shall display an error message if report generation fails due to data inconsistencies or system errors.
FR-6: The system shall provide an option to export generated reports in CSV or PDF format.
NFR-1: Report generation shall complete within 30 seconds for reports with up to 1000 records.
NFR-2: The report generation interface shall be intuitive and easy to navigate, with clear instructions and labeling.
NFR-3: The system shall ensure that student data in reports is protected and only accessible to authorized administrators.
