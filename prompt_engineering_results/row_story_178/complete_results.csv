**FINAL RECOMMENDATION:**

**EVALUATION:**

*   **Approach 1 (Technical):** Fails to address the user's core needs directly. The user story is about booking travel and receiving confirmation, not specifically about REST APIs or database technologies. While those technologies might be *used*, they are implementation details, not requirements. Low on completeness and alignment.

*   **Approach 2 (User Experience):** This is the strongest of the three. It centers around the user's journey and desired outcomes. It clearly defines how the user interacts with the system and what they expect to achieve. Good on completeness, clarity, testability, and alignment.

*   **Approach 3 (Business Rules):** Focuses on backend logic and data handling. While important, they are not the primary focus of the user story, which is about the user booking and getting confirmation. Good on feasibility but lower on completeness and alignment compared to Approach 2.

Based on the evaluation, the most effective set of requirements is **Approach 2: Focus on user experience and outcomes**.
