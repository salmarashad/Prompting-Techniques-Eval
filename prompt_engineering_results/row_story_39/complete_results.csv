Let's solve this requirement engineering task using a Reasoning-Action loop.

USER STORY:
As a music listener, I want to be able to discover new music based on my listening preferences, so that I can expand my music library.

REASONING STEP 1:
Let's identify the core functionality requested in this user story. What is the primary action or outcome the user expects?

ACTION STEP 1:
FR-1: [Primary functional requirement based on the core need]
FR-2: [Secondary functional requirement that supports the core need]

REASONING STEP 2:
Now let's consider the triggers, conditions, and context for this functionality. What needs to happen before, during, and after the main function?

ACTION STEP 2:
FR-3: [Requirement related to preconditions or triggers]
FR-4: [Requirement related to process steps or data handling]

REASONING STEP 3:
We need to consider reliability, error conditions, and alternative paths. What happens when things don't work as expected?

ACTION STEP 3:
FR-5: [Requirement addressing error handling or alternative flows]
FR-6: [Requirement addressing backup functionality or notifications]
NFR-1: [Non-functional requirement related to performance or timing]

REASONING STEP 4:
Let's consider user experience, accessibility, and other quality attributes important for this feature.

ACTION STEP 4:
NFR-2: [Non-functional requirement related to user interface or experience]
NFR-3: [Non-functional requirement related to quality attributes like accessibility or security]

FINAL REQUIREMENTS:
[Comprehensive list of all requirements developed through the reasoning-action process]

I want you to only share the specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound functional (FR) and nonfunctional (NFR) requirements as follows and do not share your reasoning with me: :

and so on..
","FR-1: The system shall recommend a playlist of at least 10 songs based on the user's listening history (defined as songs listened to at least 3 times in the last 30 days).
FR-2: The system shall allow the user to specify their preferred genres (e.g., Rock, Pop, Classical) to refine the music discovery process.
FR-3: The system shall require the user to be logged in with a valid account to access the music discovery feature.
FR-4: The system shall store the user's listening history, including song title, artist, and timestamp, to inform future recommendations.
FR-5: If no listening history is available, the system shall prompt the user to select a minimum of 3 genres to generate a recommendation playlist.
FR-6: The system shall notify the user via an in-app notification when a new recommendation playlist is available, at most once per day.
NFR-1: The system shall generate a recommendation playlist within 5 seconds of the user initiating the request.
NFR-2: The user interface for music discovery shall be intuitive and easy to navigate, with clear labels and search functionality for browsing and filtering recommendations.
NFR-3: The system shall adhere to accessibility guidelines (WCAG 2.1 AA) to ensure usability for users with disabilities.
