*   **Measurable:** Each requirement includes metrics (e.g., time in seconds, number of users, number of regions) that can be used to verify that the requirement has been met.
*   **Achievable:** The requirements are realistic and can be implemented with available technology and resources.
*   **Relevant:** The requirements directly address the user's need to access news articles from different regions.
*   **Time-Bound:** Some requirements include specific time constraints (e.g., retrieval time, update frequency).

This detailed breakdown provides a solid foundation for developers and testers to understand and implement the desired functionality. Remember to adjust these requirements based on the specific context and priorities of your project.
