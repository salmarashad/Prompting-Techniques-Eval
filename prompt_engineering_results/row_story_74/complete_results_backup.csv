Let's solve this requirement engineering task using a Reasoning-Action loop.

USER STORY:
As a team lead, I want to be able to delegate tasks to multiple team members, so that I can distribute the workload evenly and efficiently.

REASONING STEP 1:
Let's identify the core functionality requested in this user story. What is the primary action or outcome the user expects?

ACTION STEP 1:
FR-1: [Primary functional requirement based on the core need]
FR-2: [Secondary functional requirement that supports the core need]

REASONING STEP 2:
Now let's consider the triggers, conditions, and context for this functionality. What needs to happen before, during, and after the main function?

ACTION STEP 2:
FR-3: [Requirement related to preconditions or triggers]
FR-4: [Requirement related to process steps or data handling]

REASONING STEP 3:
We need to consider reliability, error conditions, and alternative paths. What happens when things don't work as expected?

ACTION STEP 3:
FR-5: [Requirement addressing error handling or alternative flows]
FR-6: [Requirement addressing backup functionality or notifications]
NFR-1: [Non-functional requirement related to performance or timing]

REASONING STEP 4:
Let's consider user experience, accessibility, and other quality attributes important for this feature.

ACTION STEP 4:
NFR-2: [Non-functional requirement related to user interface or experience]
NFR-3: [Non-functional requirement related to quality attributes like accessibility or security]

FINAL REQUIREMENTS:
[Comprehensive list of all requirements developed through the reasoning-action process]

I want you to only share the specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound functional (FR) and nonfunctional (NFR) requirements as follows and do not share your reasoning with me: : 

FR-1: 
FR-2:
NFR-1: 
NFR-2:
and so on..
","FR-1: The system shall allow a team lead to assign a task to one or more team members.
FR-2: The system shall allow the team lead to specify a deadline for the task.
FR-3: The system shall require the team lead to be authenticated and have sufficient permissions to delegate tasks.
FR-4: The system shall record the assignment of the task, including the team lead, assigned team members, and deadline.
FR-5: The system shall display an error message if the team lead attempts to assign a task to a non-existent team member or a team member without required skills/permissions.
FR-6: The system shall send a notification to the assigned team members upon task assignment.
NFR-1: The system shall assign the task to team members within 2 seconds of submission by the team lead.
NFR-2: The user interface shall clearly display the assigned team members, task details, and deadline.
NFR-3: The system shall ensure that only the team lead and assigned team members can view the task details, maintaining confidentiality.
