Let's solve this requirement engineering task using a Reasoning-Action loop.

USER STORY:
As a job seeker, I want to be able to communicate with potential employers through the job application platform, so that I can ask questions and provide additional information.

REASONING STEP 1:
Let's identify the core functionality requested in this user story. What is the primary action or outcome the user expects?

ACTION STEP 1:
FR-1: [Primary functional requirement based on the core need]
FR-2: [Secondary functional requirement that supports the core need]

REASONING STEP 2:
Now let's consider the triggers, conditions, and context for this functionality. What needs to happen before, during, and after the main function?

ACTION STEP 2:
FR-3: [Requirement related to preconditions or triggers]
FR-4: [Requirement related to process steps or data handling]

REASONING STEP 3:
We need to consider reliability, error conditions, and alternative paths. What happens when things don't work as expected?

ACTION STEP 3:
FR-5: [Requirement addressing error handling or alternative flows]
FR-6: [Requirement addressing backup functionality or notifications]
NFR-1: [Non-functional requirement related to performance or timing]

REASONING STEP 4:
Let's consider user experience, accessibility, and other quality attributes important for this feature.

ACTION STEP 4:
NFR-2: [Non-functional requirement related to user interface or experience]
NFR-3: [Non-functional requirement related to quality attributes like accessibility or security]

FINAL REQUIREMENTS:
[Comprehensive list of all requirements developed through the reasoning-action process]

I want you to only share the specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound functional (FR) and nonfunctional (NFR) requirements as follows and do not share your reasoning with me: : 

FR-1: 
FR-2:
NFR-1: 
NFR-2:
and so on..
","FR-1: The platform shall allow job seekers to send messages to potential employers regarding specific job postings.
FR-2: The platform shall allow potential employers to respond to messages from job seekers.
FR-3: Job seekers can only send messages to employers after the job seeker has submitted an application for the specific job posting.
FR-4: The platform shall maintain a record of all communications between job seekers and potential employers, associated with the specific job posting.
FR-5: The platform shall display an error message to the job seeker if a message cannot be sent due to network issues or other system errors.
FR-6: The platform shall send email notifications to both the job seeker and the potential employer when a new message is received.
NFR-1: The platform shall deliver messages with an average latency of no more than 5 seconds.
NFR-2: The messaging interface shall be intuitive and easy to use on both desktop and mobile devices.
NFR-3: The platform shall ensure that all messages are securely stored and transmitted, protecting the privacy of both job seekers and employers.
