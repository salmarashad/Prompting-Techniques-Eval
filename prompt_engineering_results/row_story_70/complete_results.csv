As a team lead, I want to be able to create tasks for my team members, so that I can assign responsibilities and keep track of progress.
","Okay, let's break down that user story and convert it into specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound (SMART) functional and non-functional requirements.

**User Story:** As a team lead, I want to be able to create tasks for my team members, so that I can assign responsibilities and keep track of progress.

**Requirements:**

**Functional Requirements (FR):**

*   **FR-1: Task Creation Interface:** The system shall provide a dedicated interface for team leads to create new tasks.
*   **FR-2: Task Attributes:** The task creation interface shall allow the team lead to specify the following attributes for each task:
    *   Task Title (mandatory, up to 255 characters)
    *   Task Description (optional, up to 1000 characters)
    *   Assignee (selection from a list of team members)
    *   Due Date (date and time)
    *   Priority (High, Medium, Low)
    *   Status (To Do, In Progress, Blocked, Completed) - initially set to ""To Do""
*   **FR-3: Assignee Selection:** The system shall provide a mechanism (e.g., dropdown list, searchable list) to select team members as assignees for a task. The list shall only display users who are members of the team led by the current user.
*   **FR-4: Task Saving:** The system shall save the created task with all specified attributes to the task database.
*   **FR-5: Task Notification:** Upon task creation and assignment, the system shall send a notification (e.g., email, in-app notification) to the assigned team member.  The notification shall include the task title, description, due date, and a link to view the task details.
*   **FR-6: Task Listing:** The system shall display a list of tasks assigned to each team member, accessible to the team lead.
*   **FR-7: Task Filtering:** The system shall allow the team lead to filter the task list by:
    *   Assignee
    *   Status
    *   Due Date (range)
    *   Priority
*   **FR-8: Task Sorting:** The system shall allow the team lead to sort the task list by:
    *   Due Date (ascending/descending)
    *   Priority (ascending/descending)
    *   Status
*   **FR-9: Task Details View:** The system shall provide a detailed view of each task, displaying all attributes and allowing the team lead to update the task status.

**Non-Functional Requirements (NFR):**

*   **NFR-1: Task Creation Response Time:** The system shall save a new task within 2 seconds of the team lead submitting the task creation form.
*   **NFR-2: Task List Loading Time:** The task list shall load within 3 seconds for a team with up to 20 members and 100 active tasks.
*   **NFR-3: Notification Delivery:** Task assignment notifications shall be delivered to team members within 5 minutes of task creation.
*   **NFR-4: Security - Access Control:** Only team leads shall be able to create and assign tasks to their team members. The system shall enforce role-based access control to prevent unauthorized task creation or modification.
*   **NFR-5: Scalability:** The system shall be able to support up to 100 team leads, each managing teams of up to 20 members, without significant performance degradation.
*   **NFR-6: Availability:** The task creation and management functionality shall be available 99.9% of the time (excluding scheduled maintenance).
*   **NFR-7: Data Persistence:** All task data shall be stored persistently and reliably, with regular backups to prevent data loss.
*   **NFR-8: Auditing:** The system shall log all task creation, assignment, and status updates, including the user who performed the action and the timestamp. This log shall be accessible to administrators for auditing purposes.

**Explanation of choices and clarifications:**

*   **Specificity:**  The requirements are very specific about what the system should do.  For example, FR-2 lists exactly what attributes the team lead needs to be able to set.
*   **Measurability:**  The NFRs are measurable.  We have concrete targets for response times, loading times, and availability.
*   **Achievability:** These requirements are realistic for a typical task management system.
*   **Relevance:**  The requirements directly address the user story's need to create tasks, assign them, and track progress.
*   **Time-bound:** The NFRs specify performance targets, which are implicitly time-bound.
*   **Functional vs. Non-Functional:** The distinction is clear.  FRs describe *what* the system does, while NFRs describe *how well* it does it.
*   **Assumptions:** I've made some assumptions about the scope of the system (e.g., it has user authentication, a database, and notification capabilities).  These assumptions would need to be validated in a real project.
*   **Error Handling:**  Error handling requirements (e.g., what happens if a user tries to assign a task to someone who isn't on their team) could be added for even greater completeness.
*   **UI/UX:** The requirements focus on functionality, but in a real project, you'd also need requirements for the user interface and user experience (e.g., ease of use, accessibility).

This detailed breakdown should provide a solid foundation for developing the task creation and management functionality.  Remember to review and refine these requirements with stakeholders to ensure they accurately reflect their needs.

   - What is their role in the system?

2. Identify the action (What do they want to do?)
   - What specific functionality is being requested?
   - What system components would be involved?

3. Identify the goal (Why do they want to do it?)
   - What is the underlying user need?
   - How does this relate to business objectives?

4. Extract assumptions and constraints
   - What implicit needs are not directly stated?
   - What technical or business constraints might apply?

Let's solve this requirement engineering task using a Reasoning-Action loop.

USER STORY:
As a team lead, I want to be able to create tasks for my team members, so that I can assign responsibilities and keep track of progress.

REASONING STEP 1:
Let's identify the core functionality requested in this user story. What is the primary action or outcome the user expects?

ACTION STEP 1:
FR-1: [Primary functional requirement based on the core need]
FR-2: [Secondary functional requirement that supports the core need]

REASONING STEP 2:
Now let's consider the triggers, conditions, and context for this functionality. What needs to happen before, during, and after the main function?

ACTION STEP 2:
FR-3: [Requirement related to preconditions or triggers]
FR-4: [Requirement related to process steps or data handling]

REASONING STEP 3:
We need to consider reliability, error conditions, and alternative paths. What happens when things don't work as expected?

ACTION STEP 3:
FR-5: [Requirement addressing error handling or alternative flows]
FR-6: [Requirement addressing backup functionality or notifications]
NFR-1: [Non-functional requirement related to performance or timing]

REASONING STEP 4:
Let's consider user experience, accessibility, and other quality attributes important for this feature.

ACTION STEP 4:
NFR-2: [Non-functional requirement related to user interface or experience]

","FR-1: The system shall allow a team lead to create a new task with a title, description, assigned team member, due date, and priority.
FR-2: The system shall store task information, including creation date, last modified date, status (e.g., To Do, In Progress, Completed), and any associated files or links.
FR-3: The team lead must be authenticated and have sufficient privileges (e.g., be designated as a team lead for a specific team) before creating a task.
FR-4: Upon task creation, the assigned team member shall receive a notification (e.g., email, in-app notification) with the task details.
FR-5: If task creation fails (e.g., due to invalid data or system error), the system shall display a clear and informative error message to the team lead.
FR-6: The system shall provide a mechanism for the team lead to edit or delete tasks, with appropriate auditing of changes.
NFR-1: Task creation should complete within 3 seconds under normal load.
NFR-2: The task creation form should be user-friendly and intuitive, with clear labels and input fields.
NFR-3: The system shall ensure that only the team lead and the assigned team member can view the details of a task.
