    *   Executive team information.
    *   Major shareholders.
    *   Recent news articles related to the company.
*   **FR-6: Data Source Attribution:** The system shall clearly identify the source and date of all displayed financial data.
*   **FR-7: Data Export:** The system shall allow users to export financial statements and data in CSV and Excel formats.
*   **FR-8: Comparison Tool:** The system shall allow users to compare financial data of multiple companies side-by-side.
*   **FR-9: Data Filtering:** The system shall allow users to filter data by year, quarter, and other relevant periods.

**Non-Functional Requirements (NFR):**

*   **NFR-1: Data Loading Performance:** The system shall load financial statements for a given company within 3 seconds.
*   **NFR-2: Data Accuracy:** The system shall maintain a data accuracy rate of at least 99.9% for financial statement data. (Regularly audited).
*   **NFR-3: Data Freshness:** The system shall update financial data within 24 hours of its official release by the company or regulatory bodies.
*   **NFR-4: System Availability:** The system shall be available 24/7 with a guaranteed uptime of 99.9%.
*   **NFR-5: Data Security:** The system shall protect financial data from unauthorized access using industry-standard security measures (e.g., encryption, access controls).

*   **NFR-7: Responsiveness:** The user interface shall remain responsive even when handling large datasets.  All user interactions (e.g., scrolling, filtering, charting) shall respond within 1 second.

**Explanation of Choices and Considerations:**

*   **Specificity:** Each requirement is focused on a specific aspect of the user's need.
*   **Measurability:**  The NFRs are quantifiable (e.g., ""within 3 seconds,"" ""99.9% accuracy"").  The FRs are testable (e.g., ""the system shall display..."").
*   **Achievability:** The requirements are realistic given current technology and resources.  (This would need to be verified in a real-world project.)
*   **Relevance:** All requirements directly address the user's goal of making informed investment decisions.
*   **Time-Bound:**  While not all requirements have explicit time limits, the NFRs specify performance expectations, and the data freshness requirement sets a timeline for data updates. We can make FRs time-bound, if it makes sense. For example, FR-3 can be updated to ""The system shall provide interactive charts and graphs to visualize financial data within 2 seconds"".

This is a more comprehensive breakdown of the user story into concrete requirements. Remember that this is just a starting point, and the specific requirements will need to be refined based on further discussions with stakeholders and a deeper understanding of the system's context.

Convert the following user story into specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound software requirements by following these steps:

USER STORY:
As a user, I want to be able to view and analyze financial statements and other corporate data for individual companies so that I can make informed investment decisions.

Follow these steps to derive the requirements:

1. Identify the actor (Who is performing the action?)
   - Who is the primary user in this story?
   - What is their role in the system?

2. Identify the action (What do they want to do?)
   - What specific functionality is being requested?
   - What system components would be involved?

3. Identify the goal (Why do they want to do it?)
   - What is the underlying user need?
   - How does this relate to business objectives?

4. Extract assumptions and constraints
   - What implicit needs are not directly stated?
   - What technical or business constraints might apply?

5. Derive detailed functional requirements (FR) from the analysis performed in the previous steps.
   - What specific behaviors must the system exhibit?
   - What are the inputs, processes, and outputs?

6. Derive non-functional requirements (NFR) from the analysis performed in the previous steps.
   - What quality attributes are important (performance, security, usability)?
   - What measurable criteria should apply?

Based on the analysis performed in the steps above, provide a numbered list of clear, specific, and testable functional (FR) and non-functional (NFR) requirements.

Let's solve this requirement engineering task using a Reasoning-Action loop.

USER STORY:
As a user, I want to be able to view and analyze financial statements and other corporate data for individual companies so that I can make informed investment decisions.

REASONING STEP 1:
Let's identify the core functionality requested in this user story. What is the primary action or outcome the user expects?

ACTION STEP 1:
FR-1: [Primary functional requirement based on the core need]
FR-2: [Secondary functional requirement that supports the core need]

REASONING STEP 2:
Now let's consider the triggers, conditions, and context for this functionality. What needs to happen before, during, and after the main function?

ACTION STEP 2:
FR-3: [Requirement related to preconditions or triggers]
FR-4: [Requirement related to process steps or data handling]

REASONING STEP 3:
We need to consider reliability, error conditions, and alternative paths. What happens when things don't work as expected?

ACTION STEP 3:
FR-5: [Requirement addressing error handling or alternative flows]
FR-6: [Requirement addressing backup functionality or notifications]
NFR-1: [Non-functional requirement related to performance or timing]

REASONING STEP 4:
Let's consider user experience, accessibility, and other quality attributes important for this feature.

ACTION STEP 4:
NFR-2: [Non-functional requirement related to user interface or experience]
NFR-3: [Non-functional requirement related to quality attributes like accessibility or security]
