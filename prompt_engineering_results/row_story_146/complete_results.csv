*   **FR-6: Color Legend (Optional):** The system shall provide an optional color legend/key within the calendar view or settings, allowing users to easily identify the meaning of each color. This legend can be toggled on/off.

**Non-Functional Requirements (NFR):**

*   **NFR-1: Color Rendering Performance:** The system shall render events with assigned colors without noticeable delay. Color updates or changes should appear within 0.5 seconds.
*   **NFR-2: Color Accessibility:** The selected color palette shall adhere to WCAG (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines) AA standards for color contrast to ensure readability for users with visual impairments. A color contrast checker shall be implemented to ensure the contrast ratio between the event title and its background color is sufficient.
*   **NFR-3: Storage Efficiency:** Event color data shall be stored efficiently and should not significantly increase the storage requirements for individual event records (e.g., should add no more than 10 bytes per event).

*   **NFR-5: Platform Compatibility:** Event colors shall be supported and displayed correctly across all supported operating systems and browsers within the defined compatibility matrix.

**Explanation and Justification:**

*   **Functional Requirements:** These requirements define *what* the system needs to do to fulfill the user's desire to color-code events. They cover the selection, display, and persistence of colors.
*   **Non-Functional Requirements:** These requirements define *how well* the system performs the color-coding functionality. They address performance, accessibility, storage, responsiveness, and compatibility.
*   **SMART:** Each requirement is designed to be:
    *   **Specific:** Clearly defines a specific aspect of the color-coding functionality.
    *   **Measurable:** Uses quantifiable metrics (e.g., number of colors, time in seconds, storage size, accessibility standards).
    *   **Achievable:** Realistic within the context of a typical calendar application.
    *   **Relevant:** Directly addresses the user's need to differentiate event types using color.
    *   **Time-bound:** Implies that the feature should be implemented within a reasonable development timeframe (although specific deadlines aren't included here, they would be defined in project planning).
