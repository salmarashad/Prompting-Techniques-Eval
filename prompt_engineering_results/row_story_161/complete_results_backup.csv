Let's solve this requirement engineering task using a Reasoning-Action loop.

USER STORY:
As a job seeker, I want to be able to track the status of my job applications, so that I know where I stand in the job application process.

REASONING STEP 1:
Let's identify the core functionality requested in this user story. What is the primary action or outcome the user expects?

ACTION STEP 1:
FR-1: [Primary functional requirement based on the core need]
FR-2: [Secondary functional requirement that supports the core need]

REASONING STEP 2:
Now let's consider the triggers, conditions, and context for this functionality. What needs to happen before, during, and after the main function?

ACTION STEP 2:
FR-3: [Requirement related to preconditions or triggers]
FR-4: [Requirement related to process steps or data handling]

REASONING STEP 3:
We need to consider reliability, error conditions, and alternative paths. What happens when things don't work as expected?

ACTION STEP 3:
FR-5: [Requirement addressing error handling or alternative flows]
FR-6: [Requirement addressing backup functionality or notifications]
NFR-1: [Non-functional requirement related to performance or timing]

REASONING STEP 4:
Let's consider user experience, accessibility, and other quality attributes important for this feature.

ACTION STEP 4:
NFR-2: [Non-functional requirement related to user interface or experience]
NFR-3: [Non-functional requirement related to quality attributes like accessibility or security]

FINAL REQUIREMENTS:
[Comprehensive list of all requirements developed through the reasoning-action process]

I want you to only share the specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound functional (FR) and nonfunctional (NFR) requirements as follows and do not share your reasoning with me: :

","FR-1: The system shall allow a job seeker to view a list of all job applications they have submitted.
FR-2: The system shall allow a job seeker to add a new job application with details including: job title, company name, application date, and current status.
FR-3: The system shall require the job seeker to be logged in before they can access the job application tracking feature.
FR-4: The system shall allow the job seeker to update the status of an existing job application from a pre-defined list of statuses (e.g., Applied, Interviewing, Offer Received, Rejected).
FR-5: The system shall display an error message if the user attempts to save a job application with missing required fields (job title, company name, application date, status).
FR-6: The system shall automatically save the last update timestamp for each job application.
NFR-1: The system shall display the list of job applications within 2 seconds of the user requesting it.
NFR-2: The job application status options shall be clearly labeled and easily understandable to the user.
NFR-3: The system shall protect the user's job application data by using secure authentication and authorization mechanisms.
