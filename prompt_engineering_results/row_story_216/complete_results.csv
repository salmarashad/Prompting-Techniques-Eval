Let's solve this requirement engineering task using a Reasoning-Action loop.

USER STORY:
As a user, I want to be able to set exercise goals so that I can track my progress.

REASONING STEP 1:
Let's identify the core functionality requested in this user story. What is the primary action or outcome the user expects?

ACTION STEP 1:
FR-1: [Primary functional requirement based on the core need]
FR-2: [Secondary functional requirement that supports the core need]

REASONING STEP 2:
Now let's consider the triggers, conditions, and context for this functionality. What needs to happen before, during, and after the main function?

ACTION STEP 2:
FR-3: [Requirement related to preconditions or triggers]
FR-4: [Requirement related to process steps or data handling]

REASONING STEP 3:
We need to consider reliability, error conditions, and alternative paths. What happens when things don't work as expected?

ACTION STEP 3:
FR-5: [Requirement addressing error handling or alternative flows]
FR-6: [Requirement addressing backup functionality or notifications]
NFR-1: [Non-functional requirement related to performance or timing]

REASONING STEP 4:
Let's consider user experience, accessibility, and other quality attributes important for this feature.

ACTION STEP 4:
NFR-2: [Non-functional requirement related to user interface or experience]
NFR-3: [Non-functional requirement related to quality attributes like accessibility or security]

FINAL REQUIREMENTS:
[Comprehensive list of all requirements developed through the reasoning-action process]

I want you to only share the specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound functional (FR) and nonfunctional (NFR) requirements as follows and do not share your reasoning with me: :

and so on..
","FR-1: The system shall allow the user to define exercise goals, specifying the exercise type (e.g., running, swimming, cycling), duration (in minutes), distance (in kilometers/miles), and/or frequency (times per week).
FR-2: The system shall store the user-defined exercise goals in a persistent data store.
FR-3: The system shall require the user to be logged in before setting exercise goals.
FR-4: The system shall validate user inputs for exercise goals, ensuring that data types are correct (e.g., duration is a number) and values are within reasonable ranges (e.g., distance is a positive number).
FR-5: If the system fails to save the exercise goal, it shall display an error message to the user, prompting them to retry or contact support.
FR-6: The system shall provide a daily notification summarizing the user's progress towards their goals.
NFR-1: The system shall save a new exercise goal within 2 seconds of the user submitting it.
NFR-2: The user interface for setting exercise goals shall be intuitive and easy to navigate, with clear instructions and visual feedback.
NFR-3: The system shall comply with WCAG 2.1 Level AA accessibility guidelines for users with disabilities when setting exercise goals.

","FR-1: The system shall allow the user to set exercise goals for at least three different exercise types (e.g., steps, distance, active minutes).
FR-2: The system shall store the user's set exercise goals persistently and display them on a dedicated ""Goals"" screen.
FR-3: The user must be logged in to the system before they can set or view exercise goals.
FR-4: The system shall record the date and time when each exercise goal was set.
FR-5: The system shall display an error message if the user attempts to set a goal with an invalid value (e.g., a negative number or a value exceeding a reasonable maximum).
