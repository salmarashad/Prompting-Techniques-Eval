Convert the following user story into specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound software requirements by following these steps:

USER STORY:
As a user, I want to receive weather alerts that include details about the severity of the weather condition and any precautions I should take.

Follow these steps to derive the requirements:

1. Identify the actor (Who is performing the action?)
   - Who is the primary user in this story?
   - What is their role in the system?

2. Identify the action (What do they want to do?)
   - What specific functionality is being requested?
   - What system components would be involved?

3. Identify the goal (Why do they want to do it?)
   - What is the underlying user need?
   - How does this relate to business objectives?

4. Extract assumptions and constraints
   - What implicit needs are not directly stated?
   - What technical or business constraints might apply?

5. Derive detailed functional requirements (FR) from the analysis performed in the previous steps.
   - What specific behaviors must the system exhibit?
   - What are the inputs, processes, and outputs?

6. Derive non-functional requirements (NFR) from the analysis performed in the previous steps.

REASONING STEP 3:
We need to consider reliability, error conditions, and alternative paths. What happens when things don't work as expected?

ACTION STEP 3:
FR-5: [Requirement addressing error handling or alternative flows]
FR-6: [Requirement addressing backup functionality or notifications]
NFR-1: [Non-functional requirement related to performance or timing]

REASONING STEP 4:
Let's consider user experience, accessibility, and other quality attributes important for this feature.

","FR-1: The system shall send weather alerts to the user when weather conditions meet predefined severity thresholds (e.g., moderate, severe, extreme).
FR-2: Each weather alert shall include a description of the weather condition (e.g., heavy rain, high winds, tornado warning) and its severity level.
FR-3: The system shall allow the user to configure their location(s) for which they want to receive weather alerts.
FR-4: The system shall retrieve weather data from a reliable weather data provider at least every 15 minutes.
FR-5: If the system fails to retrieve weather data from the primary provider, it shall automatically switch to a backup weather data provider within 60 seconds.
FR-6: The system shall notify the user if weather alerts are temporarily unavailable due to system maintenance or data provider issues.
NFR-1: The system shall deliver weather alerts to the user within 5 seconds of detecting a qualifying weather event.
