*   **Non-Functional Requirements:** These specify *how well* the system should perform. Response time, scalability, accessibility, and security are crucial for a positive user experience.
*   **Measurable:** The requirements are designed to be measurable. For example, the response time requirements (NFR-1) can be objectively tested.
*   **Achievable:** The requirements are realistic and attainable with reasonable development effort.
*   **Relevant:** All requirements directly address the user's need to easily and quickly find clothing items.
*   **Time-bound:** The response time requirements include a time constraint.

This breakdown provides a comprehensive set of requirements derived from the initial user story. Remember to tailor these requirements further based on the specific context and needs of your project. Consider the expected catalog size, user base, and performance expectations when refining the non-functional requirements.

Let's solve this requirement engineering task using a Reasoning-Action loop.

USER STORY:
As a user, I want to be able to easily search for a specific item of clothing so that I can find what I am looking for quickly.

REASONING STEP 1:
Let's identify the core functionality requested in this user story. What is the primary action or outcome the user expects?

ACTION STEP 1:
FR-1: [Primary functional requirement based on the core need]
FR-2: [Secondary functional requirement that supports the core need]

REASONING STEP 2:
Now let's consider the triggers, conditions, and context for this functionality. What needs to happen before, during, and after the main function?

ACTION STEP 2:
FR-3: [Requirement related to preconditions or triggers]
FR-4: [Requirement related to process steps or data handling]

REASONING STEP 3:
We need to consider reliability, error conditions, and alternative paths. What happens when things don't work as expected?

ACTION STEP 3:
FR-5: [Requirement addressing error handling or alternative flows]
FR-6: [Requirement addressing backup functionality or notifications]
NFR-1: [Non-functional requirement related to performance or timing]

REASONING STEP 4:
Let's consider user experience, accessibility, and other quality attributes important for this feature.

ACTION STEP 4:
NFR-2: [Non-functional requirement related to user interface or experience]
NFR-3: [Non-functional requirement related to quality attributes like accessibility or security]

FINAL REQUIREMENTS:
[Comprehensive list of all requirements developed through the reasoning-action process]

I want you to only share the specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound functional (FR) and nonfunctional (NFR) requirements as follows and do not share your reasoning with me: :
