Convert the following user story into specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound software requirements by following these steps:

USER STORY:
As a user, I want to be able to access educational resources and tools so that I can improve my investment knowledge and skills.

Follow these steps to derive the requirements:

1. Identify the actor (Who is performing the action?)
   - Who is the primary user in this story?
   - What is their role in the system?

2. Identify the action (What do they want to do?)
   - What specific functionality is being requested?
   - What system components would be involved?

3. Identify the goal (Why do they want to do it?)
   - What is the underlying user need?
   - How does this relate to business objectives?

4. Extract assumptions and constraints
   - What implicit needs are not directly stated?
   - What technical or business constraints might apply?

5. Derive detailed functional requirements (FR) from the analysis performed in the previous steps.
   - What specific behaviors must the system exhibit?
   - What are the inputs, processes, and outputs?

6. Derive non-functional requirements (NFR) from the analysis performed in the previous steps.
   - What quality attributes are important (performance, security, usability)?
   - What measurable criteria should apply?

Based on the analysis performed in the steps above, provide a numbered list of clear, specific, and testable functional (FR) and non-functional (NFR) requirements.

Output ONLY the functional (FR) and non-functional (NFR) requirements in the following format and do not share your reasoning with me:

**EVALUATION:**

Approach 1 (Technical Implementation):
- Completeness: Low - Focuses too much on the ""how"" rather than the ""what"" and ""why."" Doesn't fully address the user's need to improve investment knowledge.
- Clarity: High - Very specific technical details.
- Testability: High - Easily testable against defined technical specifications.
- Feasibility: Medium - Feasible from a technical perspective, but might not deliver the best user experience.
- Alignment: Low - Limited alignment with the core user need as it doesn't ensure the user finds and uses resources effectively.

Approach 2 (User Experience and Outcomes):
- Completeness: Medium - Addresses key user interactions and desired outcomes (search, saving, tracking progress).
- Clarity: Medium - Clearer in terms of user actions, but could be more specific in certain areas.
- Testability: Medium - Requires UI and usability testing to verify the effectiveness of the features.
- Feasibility: High - Achievable given standard web development practices.
- Alignment: High - Directly supports the user's goal of improving investment knowledge by focusing on ease of access and progress tracking.

Approach 3 (Business Rules and Data Handling):
- Completeness: Medium - Covers important aspects of resource management and access control, but doesn't directly address the user's learning journey.
- Clarity: Medium - Clear in terms of business logic, but might require further clarification on specific rules.
- Testability: Medium - Testable through functional and integration testing.
- Feasibility: High - Feasible to implement, especially if a CMS is already in place.
- Alignment: Medium - Indirectly supports the user need by ensuring resources are well-organized and accessible to the appropriate users.

Now let's consider the triggers, conditions, and context for this functionality. What needs to happen before, during, and after the main function?

ACTION STEP 2:
FR-3: [Requirement related to preconditions or triggers]
FR-4: [Requirement related to process steps or data handling]

REASONING STEP 3:
We need to consider reliability, error conditions, and alternative paths. What happens when things don't work as expected?

ACTION STEP 3:
FR-5: [Requirement addressing error handling or alternative flows]
FR-6: [Requirement addressing backup functionality or notifications]
NFR-1: [Non-functional requirement related to performance or timing]

REASONING STEP 4:
Let's consider user experience, accessibility, and other quality attributes important for this feature.

ACTION STEP 4:
NFR-2: [Non-functional requirement related to user interface or experience]
NFR-3: [Non-functional requirement related to quality attributes like accessibility or security]

Let's solve this requirement engineering task using a Reasoning-Action loop.

USER STORY:
As a user, I want to be able to access educational resources and tools so that I can improve my investment knowledge and skills.

REASONING STEP 1:
Let's identify the core functionality requested in this user story. What is the primary action or outcome the user expects?

ACTION STEP 1:
FR-1: [Primary functional requirement based on the core need]
FR-2: [Secondary functional requirement that supports the core need]

REASONING STEP 2:
Now let's consider the triggers, conditions, and context for this functionality. What needs to happen before, during, and after the main function?

ACTION STEP 2:
FR-3: [Requirement related to preconditions or triggers]
FR-4: [Requirement related to process steps or data handling]

REASONING STEP 3:
We need to consider reliability, error conditions, and alternative paths. What happens when things don't work as expected?

ACTION STEP 3:
FR-5: [Requirement addressing error handling or alternative flows]
FR-6: [Requirement addressing backup functionality or notifications]
NFR-1: [Non-functional requirement related to performance or timing]

REASONING STEP 4:
Let's consider user experience, accessibility, and other quality attributes important for this feature.

ACTION STEP 4:
NFR-2: [Non-functional requirement related to user interface or experience]
NFR-3: [Non-functional requirement related to quality attributes like accessibility or security]

","FR-1: The system shall provide a searchable repository of educational resources related to investing, including articles, videos, and interactive tutorials.
FR-2: The system shall allow users to filter educational resources based on topic (e.g., stocks, bonds, real estate), skill level (beginner, intermediate, advanced), and resource type (article, video, tutorial).
FR-3: The system shall require users to create an account and log in before accessing educational resources.
FR-4: The system shall track the user's progress through tutorials and courses, allowing them to resume where they left off.
FR-5: The system shall display an error message if a requested educational resource is unavailable and suggest alternative resources.
FR-6: The system shall periodically (e.g., daily) back up the user's progress data to prevent data loss.
