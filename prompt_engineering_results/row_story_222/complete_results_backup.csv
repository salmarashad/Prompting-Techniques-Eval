Let's solve this requirement engineering task using a Reasoning-Action loop.

USER STORY:
As a user, I want to be able to find nearby gyms and fitness classes.

REASONING STEP 1:
Let's identify the core functionality requested in this user story. What is the primary action or outcome the user expects?

ACTION STEP 1:
FR-1: [Primary functional requirement based on the core need]
FR-2: [Secondary functional requirement that supports the core need]

REASONING STEP 2:
Now let's consider the triggers, conditions, and context for this functionality. What needs to happen before, during, and after the main function?

ACTION STEP 2:
FR-3: [Requirement related to preconditions or triggers]
FR-4: [Requirement related to process steps or data handling]

REASONING STEP 3:
We need to consider reliability, error conditions, and alternative paths. What happens when things don't work as expected?

ACTION STEP 3:
FR-5: [Requirement addressing error handling or alternative flows]
FR-6: [Requirement addressing backup functionality or notifications]
NFR-1: [Non-functional requirement related to performance or timing]

REASONING STEP 4:
Let's consider user experience, accessibility, and other quality attributes important for this feature.

ACTION STEP 4:
NFR-2: [Non-functional requirement related to user interface or experience]
NFR-3: [Non-functional requirement related to quality attributes like accessibility or security]

FINAL REQUIREMENTS:
[Comprehensive list of all requirements developed through the reasoning-action process]

I want you to only share the specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound functional (FR) and nonfunctional (NFR) requirements as follows and do not share your reasoning with me: :

","FR-1: The system shall display a list of gyms and fitness classes within a specified radius of the user's current location or a specified location.
FR-2: The system shall allow the user to filter gyms and fitness classes based on criteria such as price, type of class, amenities, and opening hours.
FR-3: The system shall require the user to grant location access permission before displaying nearby gyms and fitness classes.
FR-4: The system shall store and display the name, address, contact information, and a brief description for each gym and fitness class.
FR-5: The system shall display an error message if no gyms or fitness classes are found within the specified radius.
FR-6: The system shall provide a mechanism for users to report incorrect or outdated information about gyms or fitness classes.
NFR-1: The system shall display search results within 3 seconds of the user initiating the search.
NFR-2: The user interface shall be intuitive and easy to navigate, with clear labeling and visual cues.
NFR-3: The system shall comply with accessibility guidelines (e.g., WCAG) to ensure usability for users with disabilities.
