Let's solve this requirement engineering task using a Reasoning-Action loop.

USER STORY:
As a user, I want to be able to access a wide variety of e-books so that I can discover new titles and authors.

REASONING STEP 1:
Let's identify the core functionality requested in this user story. What is the primary action or outcome the user expects?

ACTION STEP 1:
FR-1: [Primary functional requirement based on the core need]
FR-2: [Secondary functional requirement that supports the core need]

REASONING STEP 2:
Now let's consider the triggers, conditions, and context for this functionality. What needs to happen before, during, and after the main function?

ACTION STEP 2:
FR-3: [Requirement related to preconditions or triggers]
FR-4: [Requirement related to process steps or data handling]

REASONING STEP 3:
We need to consider reliability, error conditions, and alternative paths. What happens when things don't work as expected?

ACTION STEP 3:
FR-5: [Requirement addressing error handling or alternative flows]
FR-6: [Requirement addressing backup functionality or notifications]
NFR-1: [Non-functional requirement related to performance or timing]

REASONING STEP 4:
Let's consider user experience, accessibility, and other quality attributes important for this feature.

ACTION STEP 4:
NFR-2: [Non-functional requirement related to user interface or experience]
NFR-3: [Non-functional requirement related to quality attributes like accessibility or security]

FR-3: The system shall require users to be logged in before accessing the e-book catalog.
FR-4: The system shall display e-book metadata including title, author, summary, publication date, and user ratings.
FR-5: The system shall display a ""No Results Found"" message when a search query returns no matches.
FR-6: The system shall provide a mechanism for users to report broken links or incorrect e-book information, with a notification sent to administrators within 24 hours.
NFR-1: The e-book catalog search shall return results within 3 seconds.
NFR-2: The e-book catalog shall be easily navigable on both desktop and mobile devices with a responsive design.
NFR-3: The e-book catalog shall be accessible to users with disabilities, adhering to WCAG 2.1 Level AA guidelines.
