","Okay, let's break down that user story into specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound (SMART) functional and non-functional requirements.

**User Story:** As a user, I want to be able to compare multiple properties side-by-side so that I can easily compare their features and make an informed decision.

**Requirements:**

**Functional Requirements (FR):**

*   **FR-1: Property Selection:** The system shall allow the user to select at least two (2) and up to four (4) properties for comparison.
*   **FR-2: Comparison View:** The system shall present the selected properties in a side-by-side comparison view.
*   **FR-3: Displayed Attributes:** The comparison view shall display the following property attributes for each selected property:
    *   Address
    *   Price
    *   Number of Bedrooms
    *   Number of Bathrooms
    *   Square Footage
    *   Property Type (e.g., House, Apartment, Condo)
    *   Description (limited to the first 200 characters)
    *   At least 3 property images
*   **FR-4: Attribute Consistency:** The system shall display the property attributes in a consistent format across all compared properties (e.g., currency format for price, standard unit for square footage).
*   **FR-5: Scroll Synchronization:** When the user scrolls vertically within one property column in the comparison view, the other property columns shall scroll simultaneously.
*   **FR-6: Property Removal:** The system shall allow the user to remove a property from the comparison view.
*   **FR-7: Mobile Responsiveness:** The comparison view shall be responsive and adapt to different screen sizes (desktop, tablet, mobile). On smaller screens, the side-by-side view may become a scrollable list.
*   **FR-8: Link to Property Details:** Each property in the comparison view shall include a link to the full property details page.

**Non-Functional Requirements (NFR):**

*   **NFR-1: Comparison Loading Time:** The comparison view shall load within 4 seconds after the user selects the properties to compare.
*   **NFR-2: Data Accuracy:** The property data displayed in the comparison view shall be consistent with the data displayed on the individual property details page.
*   **NFR-3: Availability:** The comparison functionality shall be available 99.9% of the time.
*   **NFR-4: Concurrency:** The comparison functionality shall support at least 50 concurrent users without significant performance degradation.
*   **NFR-5: Browser Compatibility:** The comparison view shall be compatible with the latest versions of Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge.

*   **NFR-7: Accessibility:** The comparison view shall be accessible to users with disabilities, adhering to WCAG 2.1 AA guidelines. (e.g. appropriate alt text for images, keyboard navigation)

**Explanation of Choices and Considerations:**

*   **Specific Attributes (FR-3):**  I explicitly listed some key attributes to ensure the comparison is meaningful. This can be expanded based on the specific domain.
*   **Scroll Synchronization (FR-5):** This is a usability enhancement that makes it easier to compare long lists of features.
*   **Mobile Responsiveness (FR-7):**  Important for a good user experience on different devices.
*   **Loading Time (NFR-1):**  A reasonable time limit to keep users engaged.
*   **Data Accuracy (NFR-2):**  Crucial for trust in the system.
*   **Availability (NFR-3):**  A standard requirement for web applications.
*   **Concurrency (NFR-4):** Addresses how many users the system can support at once.
*   **Browser Compatibility (NFR-5):** Ensures a consistent experience across different browsers.
*   **Image Optimization (NFR-6):** Important for performance, especially with multiple images.
*   **Accessibility (NFR-7):** Ensures inclusivity for all users.

FR-1: [Primary functional requirement based on the core need]
FR-2: [Secondary functional requirement that supports the core need]

REASONING STEP 2:
Now let's consider the triggers, conditions, and context for this functionality. What needs to happen before, during, and after the main function?

ACTION STEP 2:
FR-3: [Requirement related to preconditions or triggers]
FR-4: [Requirement related to process steps or data handling]

REASONING STEP 3:
We need to consider reliability, error conditions, and alternative paths. What happens when things don't work as expected?

ACTION STEP 3:
FR-5: [Requirement addressing error handling or alternative flows]
FR-6: [Requirement addressing backup functionality or notifications]
NFR-1: [Non-functional requirement related to performance or timing]

REASONING STEP 4:
Let's consider user experience, accessibility, and other quality attributes important for this feature.

ACTION STEP 4:
NFR-2: [Non-functional requirement related to user interface or experience]
NFR-3: [Non-functional requirement related to quality attributes like accessibility or security]

FINAL REQUIREMENTS:
[Comprehensive list of all requirements developed through the reasoning-action process]

I want you to only share the specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound functional (FR) and nonfunctional (NFR) requirements as follows and do not share your reasoning with me: : 

FR-1: 
FR-2:
NFR-1: 
NFR-2:
and so on..
","FR-1: The system shall allow users to select at least two properties from a list of available properties for comparison.
FR-2: The system shall display a side-by-side comparison table of the selected properties, showing their key features (e.g., price, size, number of bedrooms, location).
FR-3: The system shall provide a mechanism for the user to search and filter properties before selecting them for comparison.
FR-4: The comparison table shall dynamically update when a user adds or removes properties from the comparison.
FR-5: If a selected property lacks information for a specific feature, the corresponding cell in the comparison table shall display ""N/A"" or a similar indicator of missing data.
FR-6: The system shall provide a visual indication if a user attempts to compare more than a maximum allowed number of properties (e.g., highlighting the ""compare"" button in red and displaying an error message).
NFR-1: The comparison table shall load within 3 seconds of the user initiating the comparison.
NFR-2: The comparison table shall be responsive and adaptable to different screen sizes (desktop, tablet, mobile).
NFR-3: The system shall adhere to WCAG 2.1 Level AA accessibility guidelines for color contrast and keyboard navigation within the comparison table.
