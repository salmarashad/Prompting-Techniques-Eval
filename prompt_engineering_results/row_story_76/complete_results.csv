Let's solve this requirement engineering task using a Reasoning-Action loop.

USER STORY:
As a manager, I want to be able to see the workload and progress of each team member, so that I can identify any bottlenecks or areas for improvement.

REASONING STEP 1:
Let's identify the core functionality requested in this user story. What is the primary action or outcome the user expects?

ACTION STEP 1:
FR-1: [Primary functional requirement based on the core need]
FR-2: [Secondary functional requirement that supports the core need]

REASONING STEP 2:
Now let's consider the triggers, conditions, and context for this functionality. What needs to happen before, during, and after the main function?

ACTION STEP 2:
FR-3: [Requirement related to preconditions or triggers]
FR-4: [Requirement related to process steps or data handling]

REASONING STEP 3:
We need to consider reliability, error conditions, and alternative paths. What happens when things don't work as expected?

ACTION STEP 3:
FR-5: [Requirement addressing error handling or alternative flows]
FR-6: [Requirement addressing backup functionality or notifications]
NFR-1: [Non-functional requirement related to performance or timing]

REASONING STEP 4:
Let's consider user experience, accessibility, and other quality attributes important for this feature.

ACTION STEP 4:
NFR-2: [Non-functional requirement related to user interface or experience]
NFR-3: [Non-functional requirement related to quality attributes like accessibility or security]

","FR-1: The system shall display a dashboard showing each team member's assigned tasks and their current status (e.g., To Do, In Progress, Completed).
FR-2: The system shall allow the manager to filter the team member workload view by project, task type, and date range.
FR-3: The system shall require team members to log their working hours against each task.
FR-4: The system shall calculate and display the percentage of completed tasks for each team member, updated daily at 6:00 AM.
FR-5: The system shall display an error message if a team member's logged hours exceed their available working hours in a day (defined as 8 hours), preventing them from saving the entry until corrected.
FR-6: The system shall send a daily email notification to the manager at 7:00 AM summarizing team member progress and highlighting any team members with overdue tasks.
NFR-1: The dashboard shall load within 3 seconds.
NFR-2: The dashboard shall be responsive and display correctly on devices with screen sizes ranging from 13-inch laptops to 27-inch monitors.
NFR-3: The system shall comply with WCAG 2.1 Level AA accessibility guidelines, ensuring usability for users with disabilities.
