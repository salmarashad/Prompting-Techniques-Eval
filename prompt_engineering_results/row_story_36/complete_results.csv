","FR-1: The system shall send weather alerts to users when severe weather conditions are predicted for their registered location(s).

FR-2: The system shall allow users to specify their registered location(s) and preferred types of weather alerts (e.g., tornado, flood, hurricane).

FR-3: The system shall require users to grant location permissions to the application before receiving location-based weather alerts.

FR-4: The system shall process weather data from at least two independent, reputable weather data providers every 15 minutes to identify potential severe weather conditions.

FR-5: In the event of failure to retrieve weather data from a primary provider, the system shall automatically switch to a secondary provider within 5 seconds.

FR-6: The system shall send a notification to the system administrator if weather data retrieval fails from all configured providers for longer than 30 minutes.

NFR-1: The system shall deliver weather alerts to users within 2 minutes of detecting a severe weather condition based on the processed data.

NFR-2: The user interface shall display weather alerts in a clear and concise manner, highlighting the type of weather event, affected location, and recommended actions.

NFR-3: The system shall encrypt all user location data at rest and in transit to protect user privacy.
