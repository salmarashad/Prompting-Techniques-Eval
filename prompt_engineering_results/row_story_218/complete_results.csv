Follow these steps to derive the requirements:

1. Identify the actor (Who is performing the action?)
   - Who is the primary user in this story?
   - What is their role in the system?

2. Identify the action (What do they want to do?)
   - What specific functionality is being requested?
   - What system components would be involved?

3. Identify the goal (Why do they want to do it?)
   - What is the underlying user need?
   - How does this relate to business objectives?

4. Extract assumptions and constraints
   - What implicit needs are not directly stated?
   - What technical or business constraints might apply?

5. Derive detailed functional requirements (FR) from the analysis performed in the previous steps.
   - What specific behaviors must the system exhibit?
   - What are the inputs, processes, and outputs?

6. Derive non-functional requirements (NFR) from the analysis performed in the previous steps.

Let's solve this requirement engineering task using a Reasoning-Action loop.

USER STORY:
As a user, I want to be able to track my blood pressure readings so that I can monitor my health.

REASONING STEP 1:
Let's identify the core functionality requested in this user story. What is the primary action or outcome the user expects?

ACTION STEP 1:
FR-1: [Primary functional requirement based on the core need]
FR-2: [Secondary functional requirement that supports the core need]

REASONING STEP 2:
Now let's consider the triggers, conditions, and context for this functionality. What needs to happen before, during, and after the main function?

ACTION STEP 2:
FR-3: [Requirement related to preconditions or triggers]
FR-4: [Requirement related to process steps or data handling]

REASONING STEP 3:
We need to consider reliability, error conditions, and alternative paths. What happens when things don't work as expected?

ACTION STEP 3:
FR-5: [Requirement addressing error handling or alternative flows]
FR-6: [Requirement addressing backup functionality or notifications]
NFR-1: [Non-functional requirement related to performance or timing]

REASONING STEP 4:
Let's consider user experience, accessibility, and other quality attributes important for this feature.

ACTION STEP 4:
NFR-2: [Non-functional requirement related to user interface or experience]
NFR-3: [Non-functional requirement related to quality attributes like accessibility or security]

","FR-1: The system shall allow the user to record blood pressure readings, including systolic pressure (mmHg), diastolic pressure (mmHg), and pulse rate (bpm), along with a timestamp, within 3 seconds of data entry.
FR-2: The system shall store all recorded blood pressure readings in a secure and persistent database.
FR-3: The system shall require user authentication (login) before allowing access to blood pressure recording functionality.
FR-4: The system shall display a history of blood pressure readings, sorted by date and time, in a tabular format.
FR-5: The system shall validate user input to ensure systolic and diastolic pressure values are within a reasonable physiological range (e.g., systolic: 50-300 mmHg, diastolic: 30-200 mmHg) and display an error message if the input is invalid.
FR-6: The system shall provide a data export functionality, allowing the user to download blood pressure readings in CSV format.
NFR-1: The system shall respond to user requests (e.g., data entry, viewing history) within 2 seconds under normal load.
NFR-2: The user interface shall be intuitive and easy to navigate, with clear labeling and instructions for recording and viewing blood pressure data, as defined by a usability test score of 4 out of 5.
NFR-3: The system shall comply with HIPAA regulations regarding the privacy and security of patient health information.
