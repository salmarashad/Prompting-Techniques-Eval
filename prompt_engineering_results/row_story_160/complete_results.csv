","Okay, let's break down that user story into specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound (SMART) functional and non-functional software requirements.

**User Story:** As a job seeker, I want to be able to apply for job openings directly from the job board, so that I can easily submit my job application.

**Requirements:**

**Functional Requirements (FR):**

*   **FR-1: Application Initiation:** The system shall display an ""Apply Now"" button or similar call-to-action (CTA) adjacent to each job posting on the job board.
*   **FR-2: Application Form Presentation:** Upon clicking the ""Apply Now"" button, the system shall present the job seeker with an application form. This form may be a pop-up, a new page, or an embedded form, depending on the design.
*   **FR-3: Required Application Fields:** The application form shall include, at a minimum, fields for:
    *   Full Name (text input)
    *   Email Address (text input, validated for email format)
    *   Phone Number (text input, validated for phone number format)
    *   Resume Upload (file upload, limited to .pdf, .doc, .docx formats, maximum file size 5MB)
    *   Cover Letter (optional text area)
*   **FR-4: Data Pre-population (If applicable):** If the job seeker is logged in, the system shall pre-populate the application form with their profile data (name, email, phone) where available. Users should be able to modify these pre-populated fields.
*   **FR-5: Submission Confirmation:** Upon successful submission of the application, the system shall display a confirmation message to the job seeker, indicating that their application has been received.  The message should include the job title applied for.
*   **FR-6: Application Submission:** The system shall transmit the application data (including uploaded resume and cover letter) to the designated system/email address for the job posting, as configured by the employer/administrator.
*   **FR-7: Form Validation:** The system shall validate all required fields on the application form before submission. If any required fields are missing or invalid, the system shall display an error message indicating which fields need to be corrected.
*   **FR-8: Resume Parsing (Optional):** The system may attempt to parse the resume to pre-populate other fields within the application form (e.g., skills, experience). If parsing is enabled, the user must be able to review and edit the parsed data before submitting the application.

**Non-Functional Requirements (NFR):**

*   **NFR-1: Application Submission Time:** The application submission process (from clicking ""Apply Now"" to receiving confirmation) shall complete within 5 seconds under normal load conditions.
*   **NFR-2: Form Responsiveness:** The application form shall be responsive and display correctly on various screen sizes (desktop, tablet, mobile).
*   **NFR-3: Security of Data Transmission:** All application data transmitted between the job seeker's browser and the server shall be encrypted using HTTPS.
*   **NFR-4: Error Message Clarity:** Error messages displayed during the application process shall be clear, concise, and informative, guiding the user on how to resolve the issue.
*   **NFR-5: System Availability:** The application submission feature shall be available 99.9% of the time.
*   **NFR-6: Scalability:** The system shall be able to handle at least 100 concurrent application submissions without significant performance degradation.
*   **NFR-7: Resume Storage:** Resumes shall be stored securely and accessible only to authorized personnel or systems.
*   **NFR-8: Data Retention:** The system shall retain application data for a period of 1 year, after which it will be archived or purged according to data retention policies.

**Explanation of Choices:**

*   **Specificity:** Each requirement is clearly defined and leaves little room for interpretation.
*   **Measurability:** The requirements include metrics (e.g., time limits, file size limits, availability percentage) that can be measured and tested.
*   **Achievability:** The requirements are realistic and can be implemented with current technology.
*   **Relevance:** The requirements directly address the user's need to easily apply for jobs.
*   **Time-Bound:** While not explicitly stated in every requirement, the implication is that these requirements should be met upon the initial release of the feature and maintained throughout the system's lifecycle.  The time limits in NFR-1 are specific time-bound performance targets.

This breakdown provides a good starting point for developers and testers to understand and implement the ""Apply Now"" functionality. Remember to refine and adjust these requirements based on specific project needs and constraints.

Convert the following user story into specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound software requirements by following these steps:

USER STORY:
As a job seeker, I want to be able to apply for job openings directly from the job board, so that I can easily submit my job application.

Follow these steps to derive the requirements:

1. Identify the actor (Who is performing the action?)
   - Who is the primary user in this story?
   - What is their role in the system?

2. Identify the action (What do they want to do?)
   - What specific functionality is being requested?
   - What system components would be involved?

3. Identify the goal (Why do they want to do it?)
   - What is the underlying user need?
   - How does this relate to business objectives?

4. Extract assumptions and constraints
   - What implicit needs are not directly stated?
   - What technical or business constraints might apply?

5. Derive detailed functional requirements (FR) from the analysis performed in the previous steps.
   - What specific behaviors must the system exhibit?
   - What are the inputs, processes, and outputs?

6. Derive non-functional requirements (NFR) from the analysis performed in the previous steps.
   - What quality attributes are important (performance, security, usability)?
   - What measurable criteria should apply?

Based on the analysis performed in the steps above, provide a numbered list of clear, specific, and testable functional (FR) and non-functional (NFR) requirements.

Output ONLY the functional (FR) and non-functional (NFR) requirements in the following format and do not share your reasoning with me:

FR-1: [Primary functional requirement based on the core need]
FR-2: [Secondary functional requirement that supports the core need]

REASONING STEP 2:
Now let's consider the triggers, conditions, and context for this functionality. What needs to happen before, during, and after the main function?

ACTION STEP 2:
FR-3: [Requirement related to preconditions or triggers]
FR-4: [Requirement related to process steps or data handling]

REASONING STEP 3:
We need to consider reliability, error conditions, and alternative paths. What happens when things don't work as expected?

ACTION STEP 3:
FR-5: [Requirement addressing error handling or alternative flows]
FR-6: [Requirement addressing backup functionality or notifications]
NFR-1: [Non-functional requirement related to performance or timing]

REASONING STEP 4:
Let's consider user experience, accessibility, and other quality attributes important for this feature.

ACTION STEP 4:
NFR-2: [Non-functional requirement related to user interface or experience]
NFR-3: [Non-functional requirement related to quality attributes like accessibility or security]
