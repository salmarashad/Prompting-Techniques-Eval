","Okay, here's the breakdown of the user story ""As a new user, I want to create a social media account so that I can connect with friends and family online"" into specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound functional and non-functional requirements:

**Functional Requirements (FR):**

*   **FR-1: Account Creation Form:** The system shall provide a registration form accessible to new users.
*   **FR-2: Required Fields:** The registration form shall require the following fields:
    *   Username (with validation for uniqueness and allowed characters)
    *   Email Address (with validation for valid email format)
    *   Password (with minimum length and complexity requirements)
*   **FR-3: Password Confirmation:** The registration form shall include a password confirmation field to ensure accurate password entry.
*   **FR-4: Terms of Service Agreement:** The system shall require users to accept the Terms of Service and Privacy Policy before account creation. A link to these documents shall be clearly displayed.

*   **FR-7: Error Handling:** The system shall display clear and informative error messages if any registration fields are invalid or if account creation fails (e.g., username already exists, email already registered).
*   **FR-8: Profile Creation:** After successful account creation, the system shall allow the user to create a profile by providing fields for:
    *   Profile Picture (optional)
    *   First Name (optional)
    *   Last Name (optional)
    *   Bio (optional)

**Non-Functional Requirements (NFR):**

*   **NFR-1: Registration Performance:** The account creation process (from form submission to successful account creation/activation) shall complete within 5 seconds under normal load conditions (defined as X concurrent registrations per minute).
*   **NFR-2: Password Security:** The system shall store passwords securely using a strong hashing algorithm (e.g., bcrypt, Argon2) with a unique salt for each user.
*   **NFR-3: Email Delivery:** The system shall ensure that account activation emails (if applicable) are delivered to users' inboxes with a success rate of at least 99%.
*   **NFR-4: Form Accessibility:** The registration form shall be accessible and usable by users with disabilities, adhering to WCAG (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines) 2.1 Level AA standards.

**Explanation of choices and additions:**

*   **Specificity:**  Each requirement is specific about what the system *must* do.
*   **Measurability:**  The NFRs include measurable metrics (e.g., time, success rate, number of users).  The ""X"" values would be replaced with actual numbers based on expected usage.
*   **Achievability:** The requirements are realistic and attainable with reasonable effort and resources.
*   **Relevance:**  All requirements directly relate to the user story of creating an account.
*   **Time-Bound:**  The NFRs related to performance include time constraints.
*   **Completeness:** I've added requirements related to security (password hashing), accessibility, and data privacy, which are crucial for a social media platform.
*   **Optional Activation:** I've included an optional account activation step. This is a common security practice.
*   **Profile Creation:** I've added a profile creation step, as this is a necessary part of connecting with friends and family.

Remember to replace the placeholder values (e.g., ""X"") with concrete numbers based on your specific project requirements and expected usage. Also, consider adding more NFRs related to security, scalability, and performance as needed.

Convert the following user story into specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound software requirements by following these steps:

USER STORY:
As a new user, I want to create a social media account so that I can connect with friends and family online.

Follow these steps to derive the requirements:

1. Identify the actor (Who is performing the action?)
   - Who is the primary user in this story?
   - What is their role in the system?

2. Identify the action (What do they want to do?)
   - What specific functionality is being requested?
   - What system components would be involved?

3. Identify the goal (Why do they want to do it?)
   - What is the underlying user need?
   - How does this relate to business objectives?

4. Extract assumptions and constraints
   - What implicit needs are not directly stated?
   - What technical or business constraints might apply?

5. Derive detailed functional requirements (FR) from the analysis performed in the previous steps.
   - What specific behaviors must the system exhibit?
   - What are the inputs, processes, and outputs?

6. Derive non-functional requirements (NFR) from the analysis performed in the previous steps.
   - What quality attributes are important (performance, security, usability)?
   - What measurable criteria should apply?

Based on the analysis performed in the steps above, provide a numbered list of clear, specific, and testable functional (FR) and non-functional (NFR) requirements.

Now let's consider the triggers, conditions, and context for this functionality. What needs to happen before, during, and after the main function?

ACTION STEP 2:
FR-3: [Requirement related to preconditions or triggers]
FR-4: [Requirement related to process steps or data handling]

REASONING STEP 3:
We need to consider reliability, error conditions, and alternative paths. What happens when things don't work as expected?

ACTION STEP 3:
FR-5: [Requirement addressing error handling or alternative flows]
FR-6: [Requirement addressing backup functionality or notifications]
NFR-1: [Non-functional requirement related to performance or timing]

REASONING STEP 4:
Let's consider user experience, accessibility, and other quality attributes important for this feature.

ACTION STEP 4:
NFR-2: [Non-functional requirement related to user interface or experience]
NFR-3: [Non-functional requirement related to quality attributes like accessibility or security]

Let's solve this requirement engineering task using a Reasoning-Action loop.

USER STORY:
As a new user, I want to create a social media account so that I can connect with friends and family online.

REASONING STEP 1:
Let's identify the core functionality requested in this user story. What is the primary action or outcome the user expects?

ACTION STEP 1:
FR-1: [Primary functional requirement based on the core need]
FR-2: [Secondary functional requirement that supports the core need]

REASONING STEP 2:
Now let's consider the triggers, conditions, and context for this functionality. What needs to happen before, during, and after the main function?

ACTION STEP 2:
FR-3: [Requirement related to preconditions or triggers]
FR-4: [Requirement related to process steps or data handling]

REASONING STEP 3:
We need to consider reliability, error conditions, and alternative paths. What happens when things don't work as expected?

FR-6: [Requirement addressing backup functionality or notifications]
NFR-1: [Non-functional requirement related to performance or timing]

REASONING STEP 4:
Let's consider user experience, accessibility, and other quality attributes important for this feature.

ACTION STEP 4:
NFR-2: [Non-functional requirement related to user interface or experience]
NFR-3: [Non-functional requirement related to quality attributes like accessibility or security]
