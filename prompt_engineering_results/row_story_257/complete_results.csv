*   **NFR-6: Data Retention:** All messages, files, tasks, and event data shall be retained for at least 1 year after the wedding date.

**Explanation of the choices made and why they address the user story:**

*   **Addressing Collaboration & Communication:**  The functional requirements directly address collaboration and communication by providing the following:
    *   **Groups:** To organize communication.
    *   **Messaging/Chat:** For direct and real-time conversations.
    *   **File Sharing:**  To distribute important documents and information.
    *   **Task Management:** For assigning and tracking tasks related to the wedding.
    *   **RSVP Tracking:** To effectively manage guest attendance.

*   **Bride/Groom Focus:** All functional requirements are designed to empower the bride/groom with tools to orchestrate and manage communication within their wedding network.

*   **Specificity & Measurability:**  Each requirement is formulated to be specific and measurable.  For example, `FR-2: Messaging Functionality: The system shall provide a messaging feature enabling bride/groom to send messages to individual participants or entire groups. The system shall support sending messages with a maximum length of 1000 characters.` states specifically what the system needs to allow and sets a size limitation of the messages, making it easier to test.

*   **Achievability & Relevance:** The requirements are designed to be achievable with reasonable development effort and are highly relevant to the needs of a bride/groom planning a wedding.

*   **Time-Bound:** While not all requirements are explicitly time-bound, NFR-1 is an example of time-bounding. NFR-5 is time-bound as well since it has to remain running during the wedding planning.
