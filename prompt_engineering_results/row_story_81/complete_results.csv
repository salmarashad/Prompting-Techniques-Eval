","FR-1: The application shall allow the user to adjust the font size of the text displayed in the reading view. Font size options shall range from 10pt to 24pt in 2pt increments.
FR-2: The application shall allow the user to select a preferred font from a list of at least five pre-installed fonts (e.g., Arial, Times New Roman, Courier New, Verdana, Calibri).
FR-3: The application shall persist the user's font size and font preference settings across sessions.
FR-4: The application shall allow the user to adjust the background color and text color of the reading view. Background color options shall include at least white, black, and a sepia tone. Text color options shall include at least black, white, and dark gray.
FR-5: If the selected background and text colors result in low contrast, the application shall display a warning message to the user.
FR-6: The application shall provide a ""Reset to Default"" button that restores the font size, font, background color, and text color to their default values.
NFR-1: The application shall apply font size and font changes within 0.5 seconds of the user selecting a new value.
NFR-2: The font size, font, background color, and text color settings shall be accessible through a clear and intuitive settings menu within the reading view.
NFR-3: The application shall ensure that all color combinations used in the reading view meet WCAG 2.1 AA contrast ratio requirements for users with visual impairments.

Let's solve this requirement engineering task using a Reasoning-Action loop.

USER STORY:
As a user, I want to be able to customize the reading experience to my preferences so that I can enjoy reading in a way that suits me best.

REASONING STEP 1:
Let's identify the core functionality requested in this user story. What is the primary action or outcome the user expects?

ACTION STEP 1:
FR-1: [Primary functional requirement based on the core need]
FR-2: [Secondary functional requirement that supports the core need]

REASONING STEP 2:
Now let's consider the triggers, conditions, and context for this functionality. What needs to happen before, during, and after the main function?

ACTION STEP 2:
FR-3: [Requirement related to preconditions or triggers]
FR-4: [Requirement related to process steps or data handling]

REASONING STEP 3:
We need to consider reliability, error conditions, and alternative paths. What happens when things don't work as expected?

ACTION STEP 3:
FR-5: [Requirement addressing error handling or alternative flows]
FR-6: [Requirement addressing backup functionality or notifications]
NFR-1: [Non-functional requirement related to performance or timing]

REASONING STEP 4:
Let's consider user experience, accessibility, and other quality attributes important for this feature.

ACTION STEP 4:
NFR-2: [Non-functional requirement related to user interface or experience]
NFR-3: [Non-functional requirement related to quality attributes like accessibility or security]

","FR-1: The system shall allow the user to adjust the font size of the text within the reading view, with a range of options from 10pt to 24pt, in 2pt increments.
FR-2: The system shall allow the user to choose from at least five different font families (e.g., Arial, Times New Roman, Open Sans, Courier New, Georgia) for the text within the reading view.
FR-3: The system shall store user preferences for font size and font family upon selection and automatically apply them to all subsequent reading sessions.
FR-4: The system shall provide options to adjust the background color of the reading view to at least three different settings: light mode (white), dark mode (black), and sepia.
FR-5: If a user selected font family is not available, the system shall default to Arial and display a non-intrusive notification informing the user of the substitution.
FR-6: The system shall provide a ""Reset to Default"" button within the settings menu that restores all reading preference settings (font size, font family, background color) to their original values.
NFR-1: The font size and font family changes shall be applied to the reading view within 0.5 seconds of the user selecting the new preference.
NFR-2: The settings menu for customizing the reading experience shall be accessible and navigable using keyboard-only input.
NFR-3: The system shall conform to WCAG 2.1 Level AA accessibility guidelines for color contrast in both light and dark modes.
