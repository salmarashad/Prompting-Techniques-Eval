*   **Achievable:** The requirements are realistic and attainable with reasonable effort and resources.
*   **Relevant:** The requirements directly relate to the user story and the client's need to stay informed about their event.
*   **Time-bound:** The non-functional requirements include time-related aspects, such as load times and update frequency.

**Key Considerations and Possible Enhancements:**

*   **Notification Options:** You could expand on the notification options (NFR-6) by allowing clients to customize the types of notifications they receive and the delivery methods (e.g., email, SMS).
*   **Audit Trail:** Consider adding an audit trail for status changes and client feedback for accountability.
*   **Granularity of Progress:**  Think about how finely you want to track progress.  Do you track progress at a high level (e.g., percentage complete) or at a more granular level (e.g., specific milestones)?
*   **Integration:** Consider possible integrations with other systems, such as project management software or communication platforms.

This expanded set of requirements should provide a solid foundation for implementing the ""view event progress and status"" feature. Remember to prioritize and refine these requirements as needed during the development process.

Convert the following user story into specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound software requirements by following these steps:

USER STORY:
As a client, I want to be able to view the progress and status of my event, so that I can stay informed and provide feedback.

Follow these steps to derive the requirements:

1. Identify the actor (Who is performing the action?)
   - Who is the primary user in this story?
   - What is their role in the system?

2. Identify the action (What do they want to do?)
   - What specific functionality is being requested?
   - What system components would be involved?

3. Identify the goal (Why do they want to do it?)
   - What is the underlying user need?
   - How does this relate to business objectives?

4. Extract assumptions and constraints
   - What implicit needs are not directly stated?
   - What technical or business constraints might apply?

5. Derive detailed functional requirements (FR) from the analysis performed in the previous steps.
   - What specific behaviors must the system exhibit?
   - What are the inputs, processes, and outputs?

6. Derive non-functional requirements (NFR) from the analysis performed in the previous steps.
   - What quality attributes are important (performance, security, usability)?
   - What measurable criteria should apply?

Based on the analysis performed in the steps above, provide a numbered list of clear, specific, and testable functional (FR) and non-functional (NFR) requirements.

Output ONLY the functional (FR) and non-functional (NFR) requirements in the following format and do not share your reasoning with me:

FR-1: [Primary functional requirement based on the core need]
FR-2: [Secondary functional requirement that supports the core need]

REASONING STEP 2:
Now let's consider the triggers, conditions, and context for this functionality. What needs to happen before, during, and after the main function?

ACTION STEP 2:
FR-3: [Requirement related to preconditions or triggers]
FR-4: [Requirement related to process steps or data handling]

REASONING STEP 3:
We need to consider reliability, error conditions, and alternative paths. What happens when things don't work as expected?

ACTION STEP 3:
FR-5: [Requirement addressing error handling or alternative flows]
FR-6: [Requirement addressing backup functionality or notifications]
NFR-1: [Non-functional requirement related to performance or timing]

REASONING STEP 4:
Let's consider user experience, accessibility, and other quality attributes important for this feature.

ACTION STEP 4:
NFR-2: [Non-functional requirement related to user interface or experience]
NFR-3: [Non-functional requirement related to quality attributes like accessibility or security]

FINAL REQUIREMENTS:
[Comprehensive list of all requirements developed through the reasoning-action process]

I want you to only share the specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound functional (FR) and nonfunctional (NFR) requirements as follows and do not share your reasoning with me: :

","FR-1: The system shall display a real-time dashboard showing the current progress and status of the client's event.
FR-2: The system shall allow the client to access the event progress and status dashboard through a secure login.
FR-3: The event must be created and initialized in the system before the client can view its progress and status.
FR-4: The system shall update the event progress and status dashboard at least every 5 minutes with the latest information.
FR-5: If the event status update fails, the system shall display an error message to the client indicating the last successful update time.
FR-6: The system shall send an email notification to the client if a critical event status change occurs (e.g., significant delay, cancellation).
NFR-1: The event progress and status dashboard shall load within 3 seconds.
NFR-2: The event progress and status dashboard shall be intuitive and easy to understand for users with minimal technical expertise.
NFR-3: The system shall comply with WCAG 2.1 Level AA accessibility guidelines for the event progress and status dashboard.

","FR-1: The system shall display the current progress of the event, including completed tasks, tasks in progress, and upcoming tasks.
FR-2: The system shall provide a status indicator for each event task (e.g., ""Completed,"" ""In Progress,"" ""Pending,"" ""Blocked"").
FR-3: The user must be authenticated and authorized to view the event details before accessing the event progress and status.
FR-4: The system shall automatically update the event progress and status in real-time based on task completion updates made by event staff.
FR-5: If the system cannot retrieve event progress data, it shall display an error message to the user, instructing them to try again later or contact support.
FR-6: The system shall send a notification to the client when the event status changes significantly (e.g., a major milestone is reached, a task is delayed).
NFR-1: The event progress and status information shall load within 3 seconds of the user requesting it.
NFR-2: The event progress and status display shall be easily understandable and accessible on all supported devices (desktop, tablet, mobile).
NFR-3: The event progress and status information shall be protected with appropriate security measures to prevent unauthorized access.
