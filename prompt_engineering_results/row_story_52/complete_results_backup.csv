","FR-1: The system shall send an alert to the user when a property matching their saved criteria becomes available.
FR-2: The system shall allow users to define and save their property search criteria (e.g., location, price range, property type, number of bedrooms).
FR-3: The system shall require users to be logged in to create and save property search criteria.
FR-4: The system shall check for new property listings matching saved user criteria at least every 15 minutes.
FR-5: If an alert fails to send (e.g., due to network error), the system shall retry sending the alert up to 3 times with a 5-minute interval between retries.
FR-6: The system shall provide a mechanism for users to manage (view, edit, delete) their saved search criteria.
NFR-1: The alert notification shall be delivered to the user within 2 minutes of a matching property being identified.
NFR-2: The alert notification shall include a direct link to the property listing on the platform.
NFR-3: The system shall ensure that user's saved search criteria are securely stored and protected from unauthorized access.

Let's solve this requirement engineering task using a Reasoning-Action loop.

USER STORY:
As a user, I want to be able to receive alerts when a property that meets my criteria becomes available so that I can stay up-to-date on the market.

REASONING STEP 1:
Let's identify the core functionality requested in this user story. What is the primary action or outcome the user expects?

ACTION STEP 1:
FR-1: [Primary functional requirement based on the core need]
FR-2: [Secondary functional requirement that supports the core need]

REASONING STEP 2:
Now let's consider the triggers, conditions, and context for this functionality. What needs to happen before, during, and after the main function?

ACTION STEP 2:
FR-3: [Requirement related to preconditions or triggers]
FR-4: [Requirement related to process steps or data handling]

REASONING STEP 3:
We need to consider reliability, error conditions, and alternative paths. What happens when things don't work as expected?

ACTION STEP 3:
FR-5: [Requirement addressing error handling or alternative flows]
FR-6: [Requirement addressing backup functionality or notifications]
NFR-1: [Non-functional requirement related to performance or timing]

REASONING STEP 4:
Let's consider user experience, accessibility, and other quality attributes important for this feature.

ACTION STEP 4:
NFR-2: [Non-functional requirement related to user interface or experience]
NFR-3: [Non-functional requirement related to quality attributes like accessibility or security]

","FR-1: The system shall automatically send an alert to the user when a property matching their saved search criteria becomes available.

FR-2: The system shall allow users to save and manage multiple search criteria.

FR-3: The user shall be able to define specific search criteria including location, price range, property type (e.g., house, apartment), number of bedrooms, and other relevant features.

FR-4: The system shall check for new property listings that match the user's saved search criteria at least every 15 minutes.

FR-5: If the system fails to send an alert due to a technical issue, it shall retry sending the alert within 5 minutes.

FR-6: The system shall log all alert sending attempts, including successes and failures, for auditing purposes.

NFR-1: The alert should be delivered to the user within 2 minutes of the property matching the criteria being added to the system, 95% of the time.

NFR-2: The user interface for managing search criteria should be intuitive and easy to use, as measured by a System Usability Scale (SUS) score of at least 70.

NFR-3: All communication channels used to send alerts (e.g., email, SMS) shall use encryption to protect user data in transit.
