Let's solve this requirement engineering task using a Reasoning-Action loop.

USER STORY:
As a user, I want to receive weather alerts that include details about the duration of the weather condition and any changes in severity.

REASONING STEP 1:
Let's identify the core functionality requested in this user story. What is the primary action or outcome the user expects?

ACTION STEP 1:
FR-1: [Primary functional requirement based on the core need]
FR-2: [Secondary functional requirement that supports the core need]

REASONING STEP 2:
Now let's consider the triggers, conditions, and context for this functionality. What needs to happen before, during, and after the main function?

ACTION STEP 2:
FR-3: [Requirement related to preconditions or triggers]
FR-4: [Requirement related to process steps or data handling]

REASONING STEP 3:
We need to consider reliability, error conditions, and alternative paths. What happens when things don't work as expected?

ACTION STEP 3:
FR-5: [Requirement addressing error handling or alternative flows]
FR-6: [Requirement addressing backup functionality or notifications]
NFR-1: [Non-functional requirement related to performance or timing]

REASONING STEP 4:
Let's consider user experience, accessibility, and other quality attributes important for this feature.

ACTION STEP 4:
NFR-2: [Non-functional requirement related to user interface or experience]
NFR-3: [Non-functional requirement related to quality attributes like accessibility or security]

FR-3: The system shall allow the user to specify the types of weather conditions for which they want to receive alerts.
FR-4: The system shall monitor weather data sources for relevant changes in severity for active weather alerts.
FR-5: The system shall send an updated alert to the user if the severity of a weather condition changes.
FR-6: The system shall send a notification to the user if the weather alert service is unavailable.
NFR-1: The system shall send weather alerts within 5 minutes of a weather event being detected.
NFR-2: The user shall be able to customize the notification preferences (e.g., sound, vibration) for weather alerts.
NFR-3: The system shall ensure that weather alert data is transmitted securely using HTTPS.
