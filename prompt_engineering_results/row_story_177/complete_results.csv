**Functional Requirements (FR):**

*   **FR-1: List Creation:** The system shall allow users to create new to-do lists, each with a unique name.
*   **FR-2: Task Addition:** The system shall allow users to add tasks to a to-do list, with the following attributes:

    *   Description (text, optional)
    *   Due Date (date/time, optional)
    *   Priority (dropdown: High, Medium, Low, optional, default: Medium)
    *   Status (dropdown: To Do, In Progress, Completed, optional, default: To Do)
*   **FR-3: Task Editing:** The system shall allow users to edit all attributes of a task.
*   **FR-4: Task Deletion:** The system shall allow users to delete tasks from a to-do list.
*   **FR-5: Task Completion:** The system shall allow users to mark tasks as ""Completed.""
*   **FR-6: List Display:** The system shall display to-do lists, with tasks ordered by:
    *   Default Order: Due Date (ascending), then Priority (High to Low), then Creation Date (ascending)
    *   Allow user to sort by Due Date, Priority, or Creation Date.
*   **FR-7: Reminder Setting:** The system shall allow users to set reminders for tasks with a due date. The user should be able to specify the reminder time as an offset from the due date (e.g., 1 hour before, 1 day before).
*   **FR-8: Reminder Delivery:** The system shall deliver reminders to the user via [Specify Delivery Method - e.g., in-app notification, email, SMS].
*   **FR-9: Reminder Persistence:** The system shall persist reminder settings even after the user logs out and logs back in.
*   **FR-10: List Deletion:** The system shall allow users to delete entire to-do lists.
*   **FR-11: Search:** The system shall allow users to search for tasks across all lists by keywords in the task name or description.

**Non-Functional Requirements (NFR):**

*   **NFR-1: Performance - Task Creation:** Task creation shall complete within 1 second under normal load conditions (defined as up to 50 concurrent users).
*   **NFR-2: Performance - List Display:** To-do lists with up to 100 tasks shall be displayed within 2 seconds under normal load conditions.
*   **NFR-3: Scalability:** The system shall support up to 100 to-do lists per user.

*   **NFR-8: Platform Compatibility:** The system shall be compatible with [Specify target platforms - e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Safari, iOS, Android].

**Explanation of Choices and Considerations:**

*   **Specificity:** The requirements are very specific about what the system should do (e.g., fields for tasks, delivery methods for reminders).
*   **Measurability:** The NFRs include quantifiable metrics (e.g., performance within X seconds, reliability of X%, SUS score of X).
*   **Achievability:** The requirements are generally achievable with common software development practices.
*   **Relevance:** The requirements directly address the user story's need to manage to-do lists and receive reminders.
*   **Time-Bound:** The NFRs specify performance targets, implying a time constraint.
*   **Delivery Method:** I've left the `[Specify Delivery Method - e.g., in-app notification, email, SMS]` for FR-8 as a placeholder. This needs to be decided based on the specific application and user preferences.
*   **Error Handling:** Consider adding specific error handling requirements (e.g., ""The system shall display a user-friendly error message if a task cannot be created due to a database error"").
*   **Edge Cases:** Consider edge cases like very long task names, large numbers of lists/tasks, etc.
*   **User Interface (UI):** While I haven't explicitly defined UI elements, the requirements implicitly dictate certain UI components (e.g., a form for creating tasks, a display for lists).  More detailed UI/UX requirements could be added.

This breakdown provides a comprehensive set of requirements derived from the user story. Remember to tailor these requirements further based on the specific context of your project.

Convert the following user story into specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound software requirements by following these steps:

USER STORY:
As a user, I want to be able to manage my to-do list and receive reminders.

Follow these steps to derive the requirements:

1. Identify the actor (Who is performing the action?)
   - Who is the primary user in this story?
   - What is their role in the system?

2. Identify the action (What do they want to do?)
   - What specific functionality is being requested?
   - What system components would be involved?

3. Identify the goal (Why do they want to do it?)
   - What is the underlying user need?
   - How does this relate to business objectives?

4. Extract assumptions and constraints
   - What implicit needs are not directly stated?
   - What technical or business constraints might apply?

5. Derive detailed functional requirements (FR) from the analysis performed in the previous steps.
   - What specific behaviors must the system exhibit?
   - What are the inputs, processes, and outputs?

6. Derive non-functional requirements (NFR) from the analysis performed in the previous steps.
   - What quality attributes are important (performance, security, usability)?
   - What measurable criteria should apply?

Based on the analysis performed in the steps above, provide a numbered list of clear, specific, and testable functional (FR) and non-functional (NFR) requirements.

Let's solve this requirement engineering task using a Reasoning-Action loop.

USER STORY:
As a user, I want to be able to manage my to-do list and receive reminders.

REASONING STEP 1:
Let's identify the core functionality requested in this user story. What is the primary action or outcome the user expects?

ACTION STEP 1:
FR-1: [Primary functional requirement based on the core need]
FR-2: [Secondary functional requirement that supports the core need]

REASONING STEP 2:
Now let's consider the triggers, conditions, and context for this functionality. What needs to happen before, during, and after the main function?

ACTION STEP 2:
FR-3: [Requirement related to preconditions or triggers]
FR-4: [Requirement related to process steps or data handling]

REASONING STEP 3:
We need to consider reliability, error conditions, and alternative paths. What happens when things don't work as expected?

ACTION STEP 3:
FR-5: [Requirement addressing error handling or alternative flows]
FR-6: [Requirement addressing backup functionality or notifications]
NFR-1: [Non-functional requirement related to performance or timing]

REASONING STEP 4:
Let's consider user experience, accessibility, and other quality attributes important for this feature.

ACTION STEP 4:
NFR-2: [Non-functional requirement related to user interface or experience]
NFR-3: [Non-functional requirement related to quality attributes like accessibility or security]
