","Here's the breakdown of the user story into functional and non-functional requirements, following the SMART criteria:

**User Story:** As a job seeker, I want to be able to receive job recommendations based on my job application profile, so that I can discover new job opportunities.

**Functional Requirements (FR):**

*   **FR-1:** The system shall analyze the job seeker's profile data, including skills, experience, education, and job preferences, to identify relevant keywords and job attributes.
    *   *Rationale:*  This ensures the system actively uses the profile data.
*   **FR-2:** The system shall compare job postings against the job seeker's profile, scoring each posting based on relevance and compatibility (e.g., skill matches, experience level, location).
    *   *Rationale:* This defines how recommendations are generated.
*   **FR-3:** The system shall present job recommendations to the job seeker in a dedicated ""Recommendations"" section on their dashboard.
    *   *Rationale:* This specifies where the recommendations are displayed.
*   **FR-4:** The system shall display at least 5 job recommendations per page and allow the job seeker to load more recommendations (e.g., via ""Load More"" button or pagination).
    *   *Rationale:* Establishes a minimum number of recommendations.
*   **FR-5:** The system shall provide job seekers with the ability to ""Like,"" ""Dislike,"" or ""Save"" job recommendations. This user feedback should be used to improve the accuracy of subsequent recommendations.
    *   *Rationale:* Allows for feedback loop and personalization
*   **FR-6:** The system shall provide a description of why the job was recommended to the job seeker (e.g., ""Matches your skills in Python and Data Analysis"").
    *   *Rationale:* Provides transparency and helps user understand recommendation criteria

**Non-Functional Requirements (NFR):**

*   **NFR-1:** The system shall generate job recommendations within 5 seconds after a job seeker logs in or updates their profile.
    *   *Rationale:* Defines a specific time constraint for generating recommendations.
*   **NFR-2:** The system shall update job recommendations at least once every 24 hours, even if the job seeker doesn't actively log in or update their profile.
    *   *Rationale:* Keeps recommendations fresh and relevant.
*   **NFR-3:** The system shall support at least 1,000 concurrent users receiving job recommendations without performance degradation (e.g., recommendation generation exceeding 5 seconds).
    *   *Rationale:* Addresses scalability and performance under load.
*   **NFR-4:** The accuracy of job recommendations, measured by the percentage of jobs ""Liked"" by the user out of the total jobs displayed, shall be at least 70% after 30 days of using the platform.
    *   *Rationale:* Sets a measurable target for recommendation accuracy.

**Explanation of how the SMART criteria are met:**

*   **Specific:** Each requirement clearly defines what the system *must* do (functional) or *how well* it must perform (non-functional).
*   **Measurable:** Requirements include quantifiable metrics (e.g., 5 seconds, 1000 concurrent users, 70% accuracy).
*   **Achievable:** Requirements are realistic given typical system capabilities.  The specific numbers can be adjusted based on the project context and available resources.
*   **Relevant:** All requirements directly support the user story and the goal of helping job seekers discover new opportunities.
*   **Time-bound:** Many requirements specify time constraints (e.g., 5 seconds for recommendation generation). The accuracy target is measured after 30 days of usage.

Convert the following user story into specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound software requirements by following these steps:

USER STORY:
As a job seeker, I want to be able to receive job recommendations based on my job application profile, so that I can discover new job opportunities.

Follow these steps to derive the requirements:

1. Identify the actor (Who is performing the action?)
   - Who is the primary user in this story?
   - What is their role in the system?

2. Identify the action (What do they want to do?)
   - What specific functionality is being requested?
   - What system components would be involved?

3. Identify the goal (Why do they want to do it?)
   - What is the underlying user need?
   - How does this relate to business objectives?

4. Extract assumptions and constraints
   - What implicit needs are not directly stated?
   - What technical or business constraints might apply?

5. Derive detailed functional requirements (FR) from the analysis performed in the previous steps.
   - What specific behaviors must the system exhibit?
   - What are the inputs, processes, and outputs?

6. Derive non-functional requirements (NFR) from the analysis performed in the previous steps.
   - What quality attributes are important (performance, security, usability)?
   - What measurable criteria should apply?

Based on the analysis performed in the steps above, provide a numbered list of clear, specific, and testable functional (FR) and non-functional (NFR) requirements.

Output ONLY the functional (FR) and non-functional (NFR) requirements in the following format and do not share your reasoning with me:

Let's solve this requirement engineering task using a Reasoning-Action loop.

USER STORY:
As a job seeker, I want to be able to receive job recommendations based on my job application profile, so that I can discover new job opportunities.

REASONING STEP 1:
Let's identify the core functionality requested in this user story. What is the primary action or outcome the user expects?

ACTION STEP 1:
FR-1: [Primary functional requirement based on the core need]
FR-2: [Secondary functional requirement that supports the core need]

REASONING STEP 2:
Now let's consider the triggers, conditions, and context for this functionality. What needs to happen before, during, and after the main function?

ACTION STEP 2:
FR-3: [Requirement related to preconditions or triggers]
FR-4: [Requirement related to process steps or data handling]

REASONING STEP 3:
We need to consider reliability, error conditions, and alternative paths. What happens when things don't work as expected?

ACTION STEP 3:
FR-5: [Requirement addressing error handling or alternative flows]
FR-6: [Requirement addressing backup functionality or notifications]
NFR-1: [Non-functional requirement related to performance or timing]

REASONING STEP 4:
Let's consider user experience, accessibility, and other quality attributes important for this feature.

ACTION STEP 4:
NFR-2: [Non-functional requirement related to user interface or experience]
NFR-3: [Non-functional requirement related to quality attributes like accessibility or security]

FINAL REQUIREMENTS:
[Comprehensive list of all requirements developed through the reasoning-action process]

I want you to only share the specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound functional (FR) and nonfunctional (NFR) requirements as follows and do not share your reasoning with me: :

and so on..
","FR-1: The system shall generate a list of job recommendations for the job seeker, displayed on the job seeker's dashboard, based on their application profile data (skills, experience, location preferences, job type preferences).
FR-2: The system shall update the job seeker's recommendation list daily.
FR-3: The system shall only provide job recommendations if the job seeker has a complete and validated application profile (i.e., all required fields are filled and confirmed).
FR-4: The system shall use a matching algorithm that compares the job seeker's profile data against the job posting data (skills required, experience level, location, job type).
FR-5: If no job recommendations are found, the system shall display a message to the job seeker indicating that no matching jobs were found and provide tips on improving their profile or expanding their search criteria.
FR-6: The system shall send a daily email notification to the job seeker if new job recommendations are available.
NFR-1: The system shall generate job recommendations within 5 seconds of the job seeker accessing their dashboard.
NFR-2: The job recommendations list shall be displayed in a clear and concise format, including the job title, company name, location, and a brief description.
NFR-3: The system shall ensure that all job recommendations displayed are accessible to users with disabilities, complying with WCAG 2.1 Level AA guidelines.
