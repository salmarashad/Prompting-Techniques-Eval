**User Story:** As a user, I want to be able to highlight and take notes on passages so that I can easily refer back to them later.

**Requirements:**

**Functional Requirements (FR):**

*   **FR-1:** The system shall allow users to select and highlight text passages within a document or content display.
*   **FR-2:** The system shall provide a minimum of 3 distinct highlighting colors (e.g., yellow, green, blue) for users to choose from.
*   **FR-3:** The system shall allow users to add a text-based note to each highlighted passage.
*   **FR-4:** The system shall automatically save highlights and notes associated with the document or content.
*   **FR-5:** The system shall provide a dedicated view or panel listing all highlights and notes associated with a specific document or content.
*   **FR-6:** The highlight/note listing shall display the highlighted text, the associated note, and the location (e.g., page number, paragraph number) within the document or content where the highlight exists.
*   **FR-7:** The system shall allow users to edit or delete existing highlights and notes.
*   **FR-8:** The system shall provide a mechanism for users to navigate directly to the highlighted passage within the document by clicking on the corresponding entry in the highlight/note listing.

**Non-Functional Requirements (NFR):**

*   **NFR-1:** Highlighting a passage shall be completed within 1 second of selection under normal load conditions.
*   **NFR-2:** Saving highlights and notes for a document shall be completed within 2 seconds.
*   **NFR-3:** The system shall support a minimum of 100 highlights and notes per document without significant performance degradation. ""Significant Performance Degradation"" means saving and listing highlights/notes do not exceed 3 seconds.
*   **NFR-4:** The highlight and note data shall be persistently stored and accessible across user sessions.
*   **NFR-5:** The highlighting functionality shall be compatible with the latest versions of Chrome, Firefox, and Safari web browsers.
*   **NFR-6:** The visual styling of highlights (colors, opacity) shall be configurable to meet accessibility standards for users with visual impairments. (e.g. Color contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1).

**Explanation of choices:**

*   **Specificity:** The requirements detail *how* the highlighting and note-taking should work, not just *that* it should exist.
*   **Measurability:** The NFRs include time-based performance targets (e.g., ""within 1 second"") and quantity limits (e.g., ""100 highlights"").
*   **Achievability:** The proposed features and performance targets are generally realistic for modern software development.
*   **Relevance:** All requirements directly address the user's need to highlight and take notes for easy reference.
*   **Time-Bound:** The performance requirements are all linked to specific timeframes (e.g., completion within a certain number of seconds). The compatibility requirement is linked to ""latest versions"" which will be updated continuously.
