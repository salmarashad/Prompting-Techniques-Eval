Follow these steps to derive the requirements:

1. Identify the actor (Who is performing the action?)
   - Who is the primary user in this story?
   - What is their role in the system?

2. Identify the action (What do they want to do?)
   - What specific functionality is being requested?
   - What system components would be involved?

3. Identify the goal (Why do they want to do it?)
   - What is the underlying user need?
   - How does this relate to business objectives?

4. Extract assumptions and constraints
   - What implicit needs are not directly stated?
   - What technical or business constraints might apply?

5. Derive detailed functional requirements (FR) from the analysis performed in the previous steps.
   - What specific behaviors must the system exhibit?
   - What are the inputs, processes, and outputs?

6. Derive non-functional requirements (NFR) from the analysis performed in the previous steps.
   - What quality attributes are important (performance, security, usability)?
   - What measurable criteria should apply?

Based on the analysis performed in the steps above, provide a numbered list of clear, specific, and testable functional (FR) and non-functional (NFR) requirements.
