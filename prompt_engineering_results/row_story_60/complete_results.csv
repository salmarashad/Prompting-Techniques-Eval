Let's solve this requirement engineering task using a Reasoning-Action loop.

USER STORY:
As a user, I want to be able to access news articles from various sources in one place.

REASONING STEP 1:
Let's identify the core functionality requested in this user story. What is the primary action or outcome the user expects?

ACTION STEP 1:
FR-1: [Primary functional requirement based on the core need]
FR-2: [Secondary functional requirement that supports the core need]

REASONING STEP 2:
Now let's consider the triggers, conditions, and context for this functionality. What needs to happen before, during, and after the main function?

ACTION STEP 2:
FR-3: [Requirement related to preconditions or triggers]
FR-4: [Requirement related to process steps or data handling]

REASONING STEP 3:
We need to consider reliability, error conditions, and alternative paths. What happens when things don't work as expected?

ACTION STEP 3:
FR-5: [Requirement addressing error handling or alternative flows]
FR-6: [Requirement addressing backup functionality or notifications]
NFR-1: [Non-functional requirement related to performance or timing]

REASONING STEP 4:
Let's consider user experience, accessibility, and other quality attributes important for this feature.

ACTION STEP 4:
NFR-2: [Non-functional requirement related to user interface or experience]
NFR-3: [Non-functional requirement related to quality attributes like accessibility or security]

FINAL REQUIREMENTS:
[Comprehensive list of all requirements developed through the reasoning-action process]

I want you to only share the specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound functional (FR) and nonfunctional (NFR) requirements as follows and do not share your reasoning with me: :

and so on..
","FR-1: The system shall display news articles from multiple, configurable news sources.
FR-2: The system shall allow the user to filter news articles based on keywords or categories.
FR-3: The system shall require the user to have an active internet connection to retrieve news articles.
FR-4: The system shall store the last retrieved news articles locally for offline access (limited to the last 24 hours).
FR-5: The system shall display an error message if a news source is unavailable.
FR-6: The system shall provide a notification when new articles are available from a followed source (user configurable).
NFR-1: The system shall retrieve and display news articles within 5 seconds of a refresh request.
NFR-2: The system shall provide a responsive user interface that adapts to different screen sizes.
NFR-3: The system shall adhere to WCAG 2.1 Level AA accessibility guidelines.
