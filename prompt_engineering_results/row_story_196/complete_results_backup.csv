**Functional Requirements (FR):**

*   **FR-1: Profile Creation Form:** The system shall provide a profile creation form accessible to authenticated users.
*   **FR-2: Required Profile Fields:** The profile creation form shall include, at minimum, fields for:
    *   Username (unique, alphanumeric)

**Non-Functional Requirements (NFR):**

*   **NFR-1: Profile Creation Response Time:** The system shall create a user profile within 2 seconds of form submission under normal load conditions.
*   **NFR-2: Profile Data Security:** All profile data, including personally identifiable information (PII), shall be stored securely and encrypted at rest.

*   **NFR-6: Data storage:** The user profile data should be stored to allow 100,000 new user registrations per day.

**Explanation and Justification:**

*   **Specificity:** Each requirement is clearly defined and leaves little room for ambiguity.
*   **Measurability:**  The requirements include metrics (e.g., response times, data storage, allowed characters) that can be objectively measured during testing.
*   **Achievability:** The requirements are generally realistic and achievable given typical software development practices and resources.
*   **Relevance:**  The requirements directly address the user's need to set up a profile and have their progress tracked.  They are essential for delivering the core functionality described in the user story.
*   **Time-bound:** The response time requirements (e.g., NFR-1, NFR-5) provide a specific timeframe for performance. The data storage volume provides a metric to test within a specific time window.
*   **Functional vs. Non-Functional:** The requirements are clearly categorized as either functional (describing what the system *does*) or non-functional (describing *how well* the system does it, or quality attributes).

**Key Considerations and Customization:**

*   **Specific Profile Fields:** The bracketed placeholders in FR-2 and FR-3 are *crucial*.  You *must* replace them with the *actual* data fields that are relevant to your application's progress tracking. The more detail you provide here, the better.
*   **Security and Privacy:** NFR-2 and NFR-4 are essential for any system handling user data. Tailor the specific regulations mentioned in NFR-4 to the relevant jurisdictions.
*   **Load Conditions:** NFR-1 and NFR-5 mention ""normal load conditions.""  You'll need to define what ""normal load conditions"" actually mean in terms of concurrent users, transaction rates, and other relevant metrics.  This will allow for proper performance testing.
*   **Error Handling:** You might want to add FRs related to error handling, such as what happens if profile creation fails, or if data validation fails.
*   **User Interface (UI):** While not explicitly stated here, you'll need to define the UI design of the profile creation and viewing screens separately (e.g., using wireframes or mockups).

Convert the following user story into specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound software requirements by following these steps:

USER STORY:
As a user, I want to be able to set up a profile so that the app can track my progress.

Follow these steps to derive the requirements:

1. Identify the actor (Who is performing the action?)
   - Who is the primary user in this story?
   - What is their role in the system?

2. Identify the action (What do they want to do?)
   - What specific functionality is being requested?
   - What system components would be involved?

3. Identify the goal (Why do they want to do it?)
   - What is the underlying user need?
   - How does this relate to business objectives?

4. Extract assumptions and constraints
   - What implicit needs are not directly stated?
   - What technical or business constraints might apply?

5. Derive detailed functional requirements (FR) from the analysis performed in the previous steps.
   - What specific behaviors must the system exhibit?
   - What are the inputs, processes, and outputs?

6. Derive non-functional requirements (NFR) from the analysis performed in the previous steps.
   - What quality attributes are important (performance, security, usability)?
   - What measurable criteria should apply?

Based on the analysis performed in the steps above, provide a numbered list of clear, specific, and testable functional (FR) and non-functional (NFR) requirements.

Let's solve this requirement engineering task using a Reasoning-Action loop.

USER STORY:
As a user, I want to be able to set up a profile so that the app can track my progress.

REASONING STEP 1:
Let's identify the core functionality requested in this user story. What is the primary action or outcome the user expects?

ACTION STEP 1:
FR-1: [Primary functional requirement based on the core need]
FR-2: [Secondary functional requirement that supports the core need]

REASONING STEP 2:
Now let's consider the triggers, conditions, and context for this functionality. What needs to happen before, during, and after the main function?

ACTION STEP 2:
FR-3: [Requirement related to preconditions or triggers]
FR-4: [Requirement related to process steps or data handling]

REASONING STEP 3:
We need to consider reliability, error conditions, and alternative paths. What happens when things don't work as expected?

ACTION STEP 3:
FR-5: [Requirement addressing error handling or alternative flows]
FR-6: [Requirement addressing backup functionality or notifications]
NFR-1: [Non-functional requirement related to performance or timing]

REASONING STEP 4:
Let's consider user experience, accessibility, and other quality attributes important for this feature.

ACTION STEP 4:
NFR-2: [Non-functional requirement related to user interface or experience]
NFR-3: [Non-functional requirement related to quality attributes like accessibility or security]

FINAL REQUIREMENTS:
[Comprehensive list of all requirements developed through the reasoning-action process]

I want you to only share the specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound functional (FR) and nonfunctional (NFR) requirements as follows and do not share your reasoning with me: :

and so on..
","FR-1: The application shall allow the user to create a profile with a unique username and password.
FR-2: The application shall store user profile information, including but not limited to name, age, and goals, in a secure database.
FR-3: The application shall prompt the user to create a profile upon initial launch or first use.
FR-4: The application shall provide a profile edit screen where users can modify their personal information and goals.
FR-5: The application shall display an error message if the username is already in use or if the password does not meet the minimum complexity requirements (e.g., at least 8 characters, one uppercase letter, one number).
FR-6: The application shall provide a password reset functionality via email verification.
NFR-1: The profile creation process shall complete within 3 seconds.
NFR-2: The profile creation and editing screens shall be intuitive and user-friendly, following established UI patterns.
NFR-3: The application shall encrypt all user profile data at rest and in transit to protect user privacy.
