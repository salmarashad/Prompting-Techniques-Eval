You need to replace them with specific, measurable values based on your system's design and performance goals. For example, ""[Number] hours/minutes"" could be ""2 hours"" or ""30 minutes"", and ""[Number] seconds"" could be ""2 seconds"" or ""5 seconds.""
*   **Refund Policy:** If your system involves refunds, be very precise about the refund calculation and the refund process. This can avoid potential customer disputes.
*   **Edge Cases:** Think about edge cases. What happens if a user tries to modify a reservation to a time that's already booked? What happens if there's a network error during cancellation?
*   **User Experience:** The user interface (UI) for modification and cancellation should be intuitive and easy to use. Provide clear instructions and confirmation messages.
*   **Security:** Make sure to implement appropriate security measures to prevent unauthorized access to reservation data and modification/cancellation actions.

By filling in the placeholders and addressing the important considerations, you'll have a comprehensive and actionable set of requirements for implementing the modify/cancel reservation functionality.

Let's solve this requirement engineering task using a Reasoning-Action loop.

USER STORY:
As a user, I want to be able to modify or cancel my parking spot reservation if needed.

REASONING STEP 1:
Let's identify the core functionality requested in this user story. What is the primary action or outcome the user expects?

ACTION STEP 1:
FR-1: [Primary functional requirement based on the core need]
FR-2: [Secondary functional requirement that supports the core need]

REASONING STEP 2:
Now let's consider the triggers, conditions, and context for this functionality. What needs to happen before, during, and after the main function?

ACTION STEP 2:
FR-3: [Requirement related to preconditions or triggers]
FR-4: [Requirement related to process steps or data handling]

REASONING STEP 3:
We need to consider reliability, error conditions, and alternative paths. What happens when things don't work as expected?

ACTION STEP 3:
FR-5: [Requirement addressing error handling or alternative flows]
FR-6: [Requirement addressing backup functionality or notifications]
NFR-1: [Non-functional requirement related to performance or timing]

REASONING STEP 4:
Let's consider user experience, accessibility, and other quality attributes important for this feature.

ACTION STEP 4:
NFR-2: [Non-functional requirement related to user interface or experience]
NFR-3: [Non-functional requirement related to quality attributes like accessibility or security]

FINAL REQUIREMENTS:

","FR-1: The system shall allow users to modify their existing parking spot reservation details (date, time, spot number) up to 2 hours before the scheduled start time.

FR-2: The system shall allow users to cancel their existing parking spot reservation and receive a full refund if canceled more than 24 hours before the scheduled start time.

FR-3: The system shall only allow modification or cancellation of a reservation if the user is authenticated and the reservation exists and is associated with the user's account.

FR-4: Upon modification of a reservation, the system shall update the database with the new reservation details and send a confirmation email to the user containing the updated information within 5 minutes.

FR-5: If a modification or cancellation request cannot be processed due to system errors, the system shall display an error message to the user and log the error for administrator review.

FR-6: Upon cancellation of a reservation, the system shall initiate a refund process and send a confirmation email to the user indicating the cancellation and refund details within 5 minutes.

NFR-1: The modification or cancellation process shall be completed within 5 seconds from the time the user submits the request.

NFR-2: The user interface for modifying or canceling a reservation shall be intuitive and easy to use, with clear instructions and confirmation messages.

NFR-3: The system shall ensure that only the authenticated user can modify or cancel their own reservations, protecting against unauthorized access.
