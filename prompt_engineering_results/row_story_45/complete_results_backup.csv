Let's solve this requirement engineering task using a Reasoning-Action loop.

USER STORY:
As a music listener, I want to be able to listen to music offline, so that I can listen to my favorite songs without an internet connection.

REASONING STEP 1:
Let's identify the core functionality requested in this user story. What is the primary action or outcome the user expects?

ACTION STEP 1:
FR-1: [Primary functional requirement based on the core need]
FR-2: [Secondary functional requirement that supports the core need]

REASONING STEP 2:
Now let's consider the triggers, conditions, and context for this functionality. What needs to happen before, during, and after the main function?

ACTION STEP 2:
FR-3: [Requirement related to preconditions or triggers]
FR-4: [Requirement related to process steps or data handling]

REASONING STEP 3:
We need to consider reliability, error conditions, and alternative paths. What happens when things don't work as expected?

ACTION STEP 3:
FR-5: [Requirement addressing error handling or alternative flows]
FR-6: [Requirement addressing backup functionality or notifications]
NFR-1: [Non-functional requirement related to performance or timing]

REASONING STEP 4:
Let's consider user experience, accessibility, and other quality attributes important for this feature.

ACTION STEP 4:
NFR-2: [Non-functional requirement related to user interface or experience]
NFR-3: [Non-functional requirement related to quality attributes like accessibility or security]

","FR-1: The application shall allow users to download songs for offline playback.
FR-2: The application shall store downloaded songs locally on the user's device.
FR-3: The application shall provide a clear indication of download status (e.g., progress bar, percentage).
FR-4: The application shall allow users to manage (e.g., delete) downloaded songs from within the application.
FR-5: The application shall notify the user if a download fails due to insufficient storage space and suggest freeing up space.
FR-6: The application shall attempt to resume interrupted downloads automatically, up to 3 times.
NFR-1: Downloaded songs shall be playable within 2 seconds of being selected for playback offline.
NFR-2: The application shall clearly indicate which songs are available for offline playback (e.g., using an icon).
NFR-3: Downloaded songs shall be encrypted to prevent unauthorized access and sharing by other applications.
