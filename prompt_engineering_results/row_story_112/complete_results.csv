*   **FR-3:** The system shall display the username (or a pseudonym if the user has chosen that option) and date of each review.
*   **FR-4:** The system shall allow users to filter the list of reviews for a parking spot by rating (e.g., show only 5-star reviews).
*   **FR-5:** The system shall display a maximum of 10 reviews per page, with pagination for accessing additional reviews (if available).
*   **FR-6:** The system shall provide a way to navigate to a specific parking spot from the review section (e.g., link to parking spot details page).
*   **FR-7:** The system shall display a message for parking spots with no reviews available (e.g., ""No reviews yet for this parking spot."").

**Non-Functional Requirements (NFR):**

*   **NFR-1:** The system shall load the reviews and ratings for a parking spot within 2 seconds under normal load conditions.
*   **NFR-2:** The review and rating information shall be displayed consistently across different devices (desktop, tablet, mobile) and browsers.

*   **NFR-4:** The system should be able to handle a minimum of 100 concurrent users viewing reviews without performance degradation.
*   **NFR-5:** The review display should be accessible and follow accessibility guidelines (e.g. WCAG) for users with disabilities.

**Explanation of choices and how they meet SMART criteria:**

*   **Specific:**  Each requirement clearly defines *what* the system must do (or how it must perform).
*   **Measurable:** The requirements include quantifiable aspects like response times (NFR-1), number of reviews per page (FR-5), and number of concurrent users (NFR-4).
*   **Achievable:** The requirements are realistic and can be implemented with reasonable effort and available technology.
*   **Relevant:** The requirements directly address the user's need to view parking spot reviews and ratings.
*   **Time-bound:** The response time requirement (NFR-1) is explicitly time-bound (within 2 seconds).  While other requirements don't have *explicit* deadlines, they are implicitly time-bound by the overall project timeline.

This detailed breakdown gives a clear direction for developers and testers. These are good starting points, but further refinement and clarification will probably be necessary during development.
