*   **NFR-6: Security:** The system shall protect downloaded articles from unauthorized access by other applications on the user's device.

**Explanation of the Requirements:**

*   **Functional Requirements:** These describe what the system *must do* to fulfill the user's need to read news articles offline. They cover downloading, storing, accessing, and managing the offline content.
*   **Non-Functional Requirements:** These describe how well the system performs the functional requirements. They address aspects like speed, storage capacity, synchronization, efficiency, security, and availability.
*   **SMART:** Each requirement is designed to be:
    *   **Specific:** Clearly defined action or characteristic.

","Okay, here's the breakdown of the user story ""As a user, I want to be able to read news articles offline"" into specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound (SMART) functional and non-functional requirements:

**Functional Requirements (FR):**

*   **FR-1: Article Download:** The system shall allow users to download individual news articles for offline access.
*   **FR-2: Offline Storage:** The system shall store downloaded articles locally on the user's device (e.g., phone or tablet).
*   **FR-3: Offline Access:** The system shall provide a mechanism (e.g., a dedicated ""Offline Articles"" section) for users to access and read downloaded articles when an internet connection is unavailable.
*   **FR-4: Download Status:** The system shall visually indicate the download status of articles (e.g., using an icon or progress bar) before, during, and after the download process.
*   **FR-5: Content Availability:** The system shall store all content (including text, images, and videos) that are embedded within the original online article.
*   **FR-6: Synchronization:** The system shall automatically check for updates to downloaded articles when an internet connection is available and prompt the user to download updated versions. (Optional but highly desirable)
*   **FR-7: Deletion:** The system shall allow users to delete downloaded articles from offline storage.

**Non-Functional Requirements (NFR):**

*   **NFR-1: Download Speed:** The system shall download an average news article (defined as X kilobytes of text and Y kilobytes of images) within 5 seconds on a stable Wi-Fi connection.
*   **NFR-2: Storage Capacity:** The system shall efficiently manage offline storage, limiting the total storage space used for downloaded articles to 500 MB by default, with an option for the user to increase this limit.
*   **NFR-3: Data Security:** The system shall protect downloaded articles from unauthorized access using standard mobile operating system security features (e.g., file encryption).
*   **NFR-4: Battery Consumption:** Downloading articles shall have a minimal impact on battery life. Downloading five average articles (as defined in NFR-1) shall not reduce battery life by more than 2% on a fully charged device.
*   **NFR-5: User Interface Performance:** The offline reading experience (scrolling, zooming, etc.) shall be smooth and responsive, with a frame rate of at least 30 frames per second on supported devices.
*   **NFR-6: Synchronization Frequency:** Article updates shall be checked no more than once per hour to minimize battery drain and data usage if a user is connected to the internet.
*   **NFR-7: Data Usage:** Article downloads should be optimized to minimize the amount of data used during the download process. Images can be converted to a lower resolution.
*   **NFR-8: Article Size:** Articles of up to 10 MB should be able to be downloaded without failures.

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Definition of ""Average Article"":**  NFR-1 needs a quantifiable definition of an ""average news article"" in terms of text and image size (e.g., ""X kilobytes of text and Y kilobytes of images""). This provides a clear benchmark for download speed testing.
*   **Device Compatibility:** The performance-related NFRs (NFR-1, NFR-5) should specify the range of supported devices and operating systems that these requirements apply to. You may need to test and optimize performance across different device categories (e.g., high-end, mid-range, low-end).
*   **Error Handling:** While not explicitly stated, consider adding functional requirements related to error handling during download, storage, and access of offline articles. For example, gracefully handle network errors, insufficient storage space, or corrupted data.
*   **User Settings:** Allowing users to configure the frequency of synchronization (NFR-6) or the default storage limit (NFR-2) is a good practice to provide a customizable experience.
*   **Analytics:** Consider adding a requirement for tracking the number of articles downloaded and read offline.
*   **Images:** Images can be converted to a lower resolution for offline reading in order to reduce download sizes, but this should be configurable by the user.

This breakdown provides a solid foundation for developing the offline reading feature. Remember to iterate and refine these requirements as needed during the development process.

Let's solve this requirement engineering task using a Reasoning-Action loop.

USER STORY:
As a user, I want to be able to read news articles offline.

REASONING STEP 1:
Let's identify the core functionality requested in this user story. What is the primary action or outcome the user expects?

ACTION STEP 1:
FR-1: [Primary functional requirement based on the core need]
FR-2: [Secondary functional requirement that supports the core need]

REASONING STEP 2:
Now let's consider the triggers, conditions, and context for this functionality. What needs to happen before, during, and after the main function?

ACTION STEP 2:
FR-3: [Requirement related to preconditions or triggers]
FR-4: [Requirement related to process steps or data handling]

REASONING STEP 3:
We need to consider reliability, error conditions, and alternative paths. What happens when things don't work as expected?

ACTION STEP 3:
FR-5: [Requirement addressing error handling or alternative flows]
FR-6: [Requirement addressing backup functionality or notifications]
NFR-1: [Non-functional requirement related to performance or timing]

REASONING STEP 4:
Let's consider user experience, accessibility, and other quality attributes important for this feature.

ACTION STEP 4:
NFR-2: [Non-functional requirement related to user interface or experience]
NFR-3: [Non-functional requirement related to quality attributes like accessibility or security]

FINAL REQUIREMENTS:
[Comprehensive list of all requirements developed through the reasoning-action process]

I want you to only share the specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound functional (FR) and nonfunctional (NFR) requirements as follows and do not share your reasoning with me: :

","FR-1: The system shall allow the user to download news articles for offline access.
FR-2: The system shall store downloaded news articles locally on the user's device.
FR-3: The system shall provide a mechanism for the user to initiate the download of a specific news article.
FR-4: The system shall periodically check for updates to downloaded articles when the device is online and notify the user of any available updates.
FR-5: The system shall display an error message to the user if a download fails and provide options to retry or cancel the download.
FR-6: The system shall allow the user to delete downloaded articles to manage storage space.
NFR-1: Downloaded news articles shall be accessible offline within 1 second of the user requesting to view them.
NFR-2: The user interface shall clearly indicate which articles are available for offline reading (e.g., with a download icon).
NFR-3: The system shall encrypt downloaded news articles to protect user privacy.
