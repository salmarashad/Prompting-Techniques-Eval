","FR-1: The system shall allow the project manager to define a project workflow consisting of a series of tasks and their dependencies.

FR-2: The system shall allow the project manager to assign roles and/or individual users to specific tasks within the workflow.

FR-3: The system shall allow the project manager to define conditions (e.g., completion of a predecessor task, specific date) that trigger the start of a task.

FR-4: The system shall automatically update the status of tasks within the workflow (e.g., To Do, In Progress, Completed) based on user actions and predefined dependencies.

FR-5: The system shall provide error notifications to the project manager and assigned users if a task cannot be started due to unmet preconditions, including a clear explanation of the unmet condition.

FR-6: The system shall automatically notify the assigned user when a task is ready to begin and the project manager when a task is completed.

NFR-1: The system shall update task statuses and trigger notifications within 5 seconds of the triggering event 95% of the time.

NFR-2: The system shall provide a visual representation of the project workflow, including task dependencies and current status, that is easily understandable and navigable.

Let's solve this requirement engineering task using a Reasoning-Action loop.

USER STORY:
As a project manager, I want to be able to set up project workflows so that tasks can be completed efficiently.

REASONING STEP 1:
Let's identify the core functionality requested in this user story. What is the primary action or outcome the user expects?

ACTION STEP 1:
FR-1: [Primary functional requirement based on the core need]
FR-2: [Secondary functional requirement that supports the core need]

REASONING STEP 2:
Now let's consider the triggers, conditions, and context for this functionality. What needs to happen before, during, and after the main function?

ACTION STEP 2:
FR-3: [Requirement related to preconditions or triggers]
FR-4: [Requirement related to process steps or data handling]

REASONING STEP 3:
We need to consider reliability, error conditions, and alternative paths. What happens when things don't work as expected?

ACTION STEP 3:
FR-5: [Requirement addressing error handling or alternative flows]
FR-6: [Requirement addressing backup functionality or notifications]
NFR-1: [Non-functional requirement related to performance or timing]

REASONING STEP 4:
Let's consider user experience, accessibility, and other quality attributes important for this feature.

ACTION STEP 4:
NFR-2: [Non-functional requirement related to user interface or experience]
NFR-3: [Non-functional requirement related to quality attributes like accessibility or security]

FINAL REQUIREMENTS:
[Comprehensive list of all requirements developed through the reasoning-action process]

I want you to only share the specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound functional (FR) and nonfunctional (NFR) requirements as follows and do not share your reasoning with me: :

","FR-1: The system shall allow the project manager to define and configure project workflows, including specifying task dependencies and assigning tasks to team members.

FR-2: The system shall allow the project manager to define different workflow templates that can be reused across multiple projects.

FR-3: The system shall allow the project manager to create a new project before defining the workflow for that project.

FR-4: The system shall automatically transition tasks to the next stage in the workflow based on pre-defined conditions (e.g., completion of a previous task).

FR-5: The system shall notify the project manager when a task is overdue or blocked due to unmet dependencies.

FR-6: The system shall provide an audit trail of all workflow changes, including who made the change and when.

NFR-1: The system shall update the workflow status within 5 seconds of a task completion.

NFR-2: The user interface for defining workflows shall be intuitive and easy to use, allowing a project manager to create a basic workflow within 30 minutes of initial use.

NFR-3: The system shall ensure that only authorized users (e.g., project managers) can modify project workflows.
