Let's solve this requirement engineering task using a Reasoning-Action loop.

USER STORY:
As a user, I want to be able to send gifts and receive confirmation.

REASONING STEP 1:
Let's identify the core functionality requested in this user story. What is the primary action or outcome the user expects?

ACTION STEP 1:
FR-1: [Primary functional requirement based on the core need]
FR-2: [Secondary functional requirement that supports the core need]

REASONING STEP 2:
Now let's consider the triggers, conditions, and context for this functionality. What needs to happen before, during, and after the main function?

ACTION STEP 2:
FR-3: [Requirement related to preconditions or triggers]
FR-4: [Requirement related to process steps or data handling]

","FR-1: The system shall allow a user to initiate the sending of a gift to another user.
FR-2: The system shall provide the sender with a confirmation message upon successful gift transmission.
FR-3: The sending user must have sufficient funds (real or virtual currency) or available gifts to send a gift.
FR-4: The system shall record the gift transaction, including sender, receiver, gift type, and timestamp.
FR-5: The system shall display an error message to the sender if the gift transmission fails (e.g., insufficient funds, invalid recipient).
FR-6: The system shall provide a notification to the recipient upon receiving a gift.
NFR-1: The gift sending process shall complete within 5 seconds.
NFR-2: The confirmation message shall be clearly displayed to the sender within 1 second of successful gift transmission.
NFR-3: The system shall ensure that gift transactions are secure and prevent unauthorized access or modification.
