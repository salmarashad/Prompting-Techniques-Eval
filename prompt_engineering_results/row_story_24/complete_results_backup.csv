You are a Senior Requirements Engineer with 15 years of experience in software development. Your expertise is in translating business needs into technical specifications that bridge business goals and development work.

APPROACH THIS TASK AS A PROFESSIONAL WOULD:
- Consider system architecture implications
- Think about integration points with other systems
- Address security and compliance needs
- Consider maintenance and supportability

USER STORY:
As a customer, I want to be able to receive recommendations for products based on my browsing and purchase history.

Produce a set of professional-grade specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound requirements that would be ready for development team implementation. Include:
1. Numbered functional requirements (with FR prefix)
2. Numbered non-functional requirements (with NFR prefix)
3. Potential risks or dependencies

I want you to only share the functional (FR) and nonfunctional (NFR) requirements as follows and do not share your reasoning with me:

","FR-1: The system shall track and store customer browsing history, including product views, search queries, and items added to the cart, for logged-in users. Data retention period shall be 24 months, after which browsing history will be anonymized.

FR-2: The system shall track and store customer purchase history, including product IDs, purchase dates, quantities, and total order value, for logged-in users. This data shall be retained indefinitely.

FR-3: The system shall provide a batch process, executed daily at 03:00 AM UTC, to analyze browsing and purchase history data to generate product recommendations for each customer. The process should complete within 4 hours.

FR-4: The system shall implement a recommendation algorithm that considers:
    a. Products frequently viewed or added to the cart together.
    b. Products similar to those previously purchased, based on product category and attributes.
    c. Trending products within the customer's general geographic region (based on IP address).

FR-5: The system shall present a maximum of 10 product recommendations to the customer, displayed on the homepage and product detail pages.

FR-6: The system shall provide an API endpoint for retrieving product recommendations for a specific customer ID. This API must respond within 200ms under normal load (defined as 100 concurrent requests).

FR-7: The system shall allow customers to provide explicit feedback on recommendations (e.g., ""Not Interested,"" ""Relevant"") to improve future recommendations. This feedback must be stored and incorporated into the recommendation algorithm.

FR-8: The system shall provide an administrative interface to monitor the performance of the recommendation engine, including metrics such as click-through rate, conversion rate, and average order value of recommended products.

FR-9: The system shall comply with GDPR and CCPA regulations regarding data privacy and user consent for data tracking and usage.

NFR-1: The recommendation engine shall be scalable to handle up to 1 million daily active users without performance degradation (defined as API response time exceeding 500ms).

NFR-2: The system shall be highly available, with a target uptime of 99.9%, achieved through redundancy and failover mechanisms.

NFR-3: The system shall be secure, protecting customer data from unauthorized access and modification, in compliance with OWASP guidelines. Data at rest and in transit must be encrypted.

NFR-4: The system shall be maintainable, with well-documented code and a modular architecture to facilitate future enhancements and bug fixes.

NFR-5: The system shall be testable, with automated unit and integration tests covering at least 80% of the code.

NFR-6: The system shall integrate seamlessly with the existing e-commerce platform's user authentication and product catalog services. API integration latency must not exceed 50ms.

NFR-7: The system shall be performance-optimized to minimize resource consumption (CPU, memory, storage) to reduce operational costs.
