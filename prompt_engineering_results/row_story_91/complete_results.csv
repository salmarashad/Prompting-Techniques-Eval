","Okay, let's break down that user story and convert it into specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound (SMART) functional and non-functional software requirements.

**User Story:** As a user, I want to be able to filter my search results based on specific criteria so that I can narrow down my options.

**Requirements:**

**Functional Requirements (FR):**

*   **FR-1: The system shall provide a filtering interface alongside search results.**
    *   *Details:* This interface should be clearly visible and easily accessible to the user after a search has been performed.

*   **FR-2: The system shall offer filter options based on [Specific Criteria List - See Note Below].**
    *   *Details:*  The system shall provide filters for, at minimum, the following criteria:
        *   Price Range (minimum and maximum values)
        *   [Example: Category (e.g., Electronics, Clothing, Books)]
        *   [Example: Rating (e.g., 4 stars and above, 3 stars and above)]
        *   [Example: Availability (e.g., In Stock Only)]
        *   [Example: Brand (e.g., Brand A, Brand B, Brand C)]
        *   The criteria list should be configurable by an administrator (see admin requirements).

*   **FR-3: The system shall dynamically update search results based on applied filters.**
    *   *Details:* When a user applies or changes a filter, the search results displayed should update automatically without requiring a full page reload.

*   **FR-4: The system shall display the number of results that match the applied filters.**
    *   *Details:* The filter interface should display the number of matching results next to each filter option (e.g., ""Brand A (25)"", ""Brand B (12)"").

*   **FR-5: The system shall allow users to apply multiple filters simultaneously.**
    *   *Details:* Users should be able to select multiple options within a single filter category (e.g., multiple brands) and across different filter categories (e.g., a price range and a specific brand).

*   **FR-6: The system shall provide a mechanism to clear all applied filters.**
    *   *Details:* A button or link (e.g., ""Clear Filters"", ""Reset"") should be available to remove all currently active filters.

*   **FR-7: The system shall persist filter selections across page navigations within the search results.**
    *   *Details:* If a user navigates to a different page of the search results, the previously applied filters should remain active.

**Non-Functional Requirements (NFR):**

*   **NFR-1: Filter application and results update shall complete within 2 seconds under normal load conditions.**
    *   *Details:* From the moment a user applies or changes a filter to the moment the updated search results are displayed, the process should take no more than 2 seconds.

*   **NFR-2: The filtering interface shall be responsive and usable on devices with screen sizes ranging from 320px to 1920px width.**
    *   *Details:* The filter options and layout should adapt to different screen sizes (mobile, tablet, desktop) without significant usability issues.

*   **NFR-3: The system shall be able to handle at least 10 concurrent users applying filters simultaneously without significant performance degradation.**
    *   *Details:* The system should be able to maintain acceptable performance levels even with multiple users filtering search results at the same time.

*   **NFR-4: The filter options shall be easily discoverable and understandable by users with varying levels of technical expertise.**
    *   *Details:* The filter labels and descriptions should be clear, concise, and use language that is accessible to a broad audience.

**Notes:**

*   **[Specific Criteria List]:**  The specific criteria for filtering (mentioned in FR-2) is crucial and depends entirely on the type of data being searched. Replace the example criteria with the actual filters relevant to the application.  This needs to be clearly defined in the project requirements.
*   **Error Handling:**  Consider adding functional requirements for handling edge cases, such as no results matching the applied filters (e.g., displaying a message like ""No results found matching your criteria."")
*   **Accessibility:** Consider adding non-functional requirements for accessibility, such as ensuring the filtering interface is accessible to users with disabilities (e.g., using ARIA attributes for screen reader compatibility).

This breakdown provides a more concrete and actionable set of requirements based on the initial user story. Remember to tailor the specific criteria and performance metrics to the specific context of your application.

**Assumptions:**

*   The ""search results"" are implied to be based on some pre-existing search functionality. We're building the *filtering* aspect on top of that.
*   ""Specific criteria"" needs to be clarified. Let's assume for this example that the system allows searching and filtering a library of books and that the criteria are author, genre, and publication year.

**Requirements:**

**Functional Requirements (FR):**

*   **FR-1:** The system shall provide a filter interface on the search results page.
*   **FR-2:** The filter interface shall include the following filter criteria:

*   **FR-3:** The system shall dynamically update the search results upon application of any filter criteria.
*   **FR-4:** The system shall display the number of results matching the selected filter criteria alongside each filter option, or after the filtering has occurred.
*   **FR-5:** The system shall allow the user to clear all applied filters with a single ""Clear Filters"" action.

*   **NFR-2:** The filter interface shall be responsive and usable on devices with screen sizes ranging from 320px to 1920px width.
*   **NFR-3:** The system shall maintain the selected filter criteria when the user navigates away from and returns to the search results page (e.g., by clicking on a result link and then pressing 'back').
*   **NFR-4:** The loading of the filter options (list of genres, author names) shall not noticeably delay the initial display of the search results page. (e.g. load within 1 second)
*   **NFR-5:** The filter interface shall be easily accessible via keyboard navigation for users with disabilities.

Let's solve this requirement engineering task using a Reasoning-Action loop.

USER STORY:
As a user, I want to be able to filter my search results based on specific criteria so that I can narrow down my options.

REASONING STEP 1:
Let's identify the core functionality requested in this user story. What is the primary action or outcome the user expects?

ACTION STEP 1:
FR-1: [Primary functional requirement based on the core need]
FR-2: [Secondary functional requirement that supports the core need]

REASONING STEP 2:
Now let's consider the triggers, conditions, and context for this functionality. What needs to happen before, during, and after the main function?

ACTION STEP 2:
FR-3: [Requirement related to preconditions or triggers]
FR-4: [Requirement related to process steps or data handling]

REASONING STEP 3:
We need to consider reliability, error conditions, and alternative paths. What happens when things don't work as expected?

ACTION STEP 3:
FR-5: [Requirement addressing error handling or alternative flows]
FR-6: [Requirement addressing backup functionality or notifications]
NFR-1: [Non-functional requirement related to performance or timing]

REASONING STEP 4:
Let's consider user experience, accessibility, and other quality attributes important for this feature.

ACTION STEP 4:
NFR-2: [Non-functional requirement related to user interface or experience]
NFR-3: [Non-functional requirement related to quality attributes like accessibility or security]

FINAL REQUIREMENTS:
[Comprehensive list of all requirements developed through the reasoning-action process]
