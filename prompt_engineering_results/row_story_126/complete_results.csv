*   **NFR-6: Compatibility:** The integrated document viewer shall be compatible with the latest versions of Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge browsers.

**Explanation and Justification:**

*   **Functional Requirements:**  These describe what the system *must do* to meet the user's need. They focus on the features and functionalities.
    *   `Document Listing`: Directly addresses the user's need to *view* documents.
    *   `Document Preview`: Provides quick access to document content.
    *   `Document Download`: Enables offline access and archiving.
    *   `Document Search`: Facilitates finding specific information within documents.
    *   `Access Control`: Ensures secure access and prevents unauthorized viewing.
    *   `Document Viewer`: Ensures seamless browsing and access of document contents.
    *   `Document Metadata`: Gives the user more context about the document.

*   **Non-Functional Requirements:** These describe how well the system performs, focusing on qualities like performance, security, and usability. They are important for overall user satisfaction.
    *   `Document Loading Performance`: Specifies a time limit for loading the document list, ensuring a responsive user experience.
    *   `Download Speed`: Guarantees reasonable download speeds for accessing the documents.
    *   `System Availability`: Defines the uptime requirement for the document viewing functionality.
    *   `Security`: Highlights the importance of secure access to sensitive project documents.
    *   `Scalability`: Ensures that the system can handle a reasonable number of concurrent users without performance issues.
    *   `Compatibility`: Makes sure that the document viewer works on all common browsers.

These requirements are:

*   **Specific:** They clearly define what needs to be implemented.
*   **Measurable:** They include metrics (e.g., time limits, download speeds) that can be used to verify that the requirements are met.
*   **Achievable:** They are realistic and achievable given current technology and resources.
*   **Relevant:** They directly relate to the user's need to access project documents.
*   **Time-bound:**  Performance related NFRs are time-bound. Others are implicitly time-bound by the overall project timeline.

This breakdown provides a solid foundation for development and testing. Remember that this is a starting point, and the requirements might need to be refined further as the project progresses.
