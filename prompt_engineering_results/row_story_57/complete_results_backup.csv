Convert the following user story into specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound software requirements by following these steps:

USER STORY:
As a user, I want to be able to view 3D virtual tours of properties so that I can get a more immersive experience of the property.

Follow these steps to derive the requirements:

1. Identify the actor (Who is performing the action?)
   - Who is the primary user in this story?
   - What is their role in the system?

2. Identify the action (What do they want to do?)
   - What specific functionality is being requested?
   - What system components would be involved?

3. Identify the goal (Why do they want to do it?)
   - What is the underlying user need?
   - How does this relate to business objectives?

4. Extract assumptions and constraints
   - What implicit needs are not directly stated?
   - What technical or business constraints might apply?

5. Derive detailed functional requirements (FR) from the analysis performed in the previous steps.
   - What specific behaviors must the system exhibit?
   - What are the inputs, processes, and outputs?

6. Derive non-functional requirements (NFR) from the analysis performed in the previous steps.
   - What quality attributes are important (performance, security, usability)?
   - What measurable criteria should apply?

Based on the analysis performed in the steps above, provide a numbered list of clear, specific, and testable functional (FR) and non-functional (NFR) requirements.

As a user, I want to be able to view 3D virtual tours of properties so that I can get a more immersive experience of the property.

REASONING STEP 1:
Let's identify the core functionality requested in this user story. What is the primary action or outcome the user expects?

ACTION STEP 1:
FR-1: [Primary functional requirement based on the core need]
FR-2: [Secondary functional requirement that supports the core need]

REASONING STEP 2:
Now let's consider the triggers, conditions, and context for this functionality. What needs to happen before, during, and after the main function?

ACTION STEP 2:
FR-3: [Requirement related to preconditions or triggers]
FR-4: [Requirement related to process steps or data handling]

REASONING STEP 3:
We need to consider reliability, error conditions, and alternative paths. What happens when things don't work as expected?

ACTION STEP 3:
FR-5: [Requirement addressing error handling or alternative flows]
FR-6: [Requirement addressing backup functionality or notifications]
NFR-1: [Non-functional requirement related to performance or timing]

REASONING STEP 4:
Let's consider user experience, accessibility, and other quality attributes important for this feature.

ACTION STEP 4:
NFR-2: [Non-functional requirement related to user interface or experience]
NFR-3: [Non-functional requirement related to quality attributes like accessibility or security]

FINAL REQUIREMENTS:

","FR-1: The system shall display a 3D virtual tour of a property when the user selects the ""View 3D Tour"" option on the property details page.
FR-2: The system shall allow the user to navigate the 3D virtual tour using mouse clicks, keyboard controls (e.g., arrow keys), or touch gestures (on touch-enabled devices).
FR-3: The system shall display a ""View 3D Tour"" option only if a 3D virtual tour is available for the selected property.
FR-4: The system shall load the 3D virtual tour data within 5 seconds of the user selecting the ""View 3D Tour"" option.
FR-5: If the 3D virtual tour fails to load, the system shall display an error message to the user, suggesting they try again later or contact support.
FR-6: The system shall provide a fallback option to view 2D images of the property if the 3D virtual tour is unavailable.
NFR-1: The 3D virtual tour shall maintain a frame rate of at least 30 frames per second on devices meeting the minimum system requirements.
NFR-2: The user interface for the 3D virtual tour shall be intuitive and easy to use, with clear controls for navigation and interaction.
NFR-3: The 3D virtual tour shall be accessible to users with disabilities, adhering to WCAG 2.1 Level AA guidelines, including providing alternative text for interactive elements and ensuring keyboard navigation.
