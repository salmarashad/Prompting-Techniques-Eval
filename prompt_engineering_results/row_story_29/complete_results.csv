","Okay, let's break down the user story ""As a user, I want to receive weather alerts via push notifications on my mobile device"" into functional and non-functional software requirements.

**Functional Requirements (FR):**

*   **FR-1:** The system shall allow users to subscribe to weather alerts based on their location(s). (Implies a mechanism to set location(s))
*   **FR-2:** The system shall allow users to specify the types of weather alerts they wish to receive (e.g., rain, snow, temperature drops, wind speed).
*   **FR-3:** The system shall integrate with a reliable weather data provider. (Implies selecting and connecting to an external API)
*   **FR-4:** The system shall process weather data from the weather data provider and identify conditions that meet the user's alert criteria.

*   **FR-6:** The system shall deliver push notifications to the user's mobile device when alert criteria are met.
*   **FR-7:** The system shall allow users to unsubscribe from weather alerts.
*   **FR-8:** The system shall provide a settings screen that enable users to enable/disable weather alerts in general.
*   **FR-9:** The system shall handle scenarios where the device does not have push notifications enabled. (e.g. displaying a local notification, alerting the user.)

**Non-Functional Requirements (NFR):**

*   **NFR-1:** The system shall deliver push notifications within 2 minutes of the weather event being detected by the weather data provider.
*   **NFR-2:** The push notification delivery mechanism shall support at least 10,000 concurrent users without significant performance degradation (e.g., notification delivery delay exceeding 5 minutes). (Scalability)
*   **NFR-3:** The system shall consume a minimal amount of battery power when monitoring for weather alerts in the background (e.g., less than 5% battery drain per hour). (Power efficiency)
*   **NFR-4:** The application shall gracefully handle temporary loss of network connectivity and resend pending notifications when connectivity is restored. (Reliability)
*   **NFR-5:** The size of a push notification shall not exceed 2KB. (Performance/Bandwidth)
*   **NFR-6:** The system shall comply with relevant data privacy regulations regarding user location data. (Security/Privacy)

*   **Achievable and Relevant:**  The requirements are realistic given typical mobile development capabilities and are directly tied to the user's need for weather alerts.
*   **Time-Bound:** Some of the NFRs have time constraints (e.g., delivery time).  This is crucial for the alerts to be useful.
*   **Functional vs. Non-Functional:** The separation helps the development team understand *what* the system does (FRs) vs. *how well* it does it (NFRs).  Both are essential for a successful product.

This breakdown provides a good starting point. Depending on the specific context and priorities of the project, these requirements could be further refined and expanded.

Follow these steps to derive the requirements:

1. Identify the actor (Who is performing the action?)
   - Who is the primary user in this story?
   - What is their role in the system?

2. Identify the action (What do they want to do?)
   - What specific functionality is being requested?
   - What system components would be involved?

3. Identify the goal (Why do they want to do it?)
   - What is the underlying user need?
   - How does this relate to business objectives?

4. Extract assumptions and constraints
   - What implicit needs are not directly stated?
   - What technical or business constraints might apply?

5. Derive detailed functional requirements (FR) from the analysis performed in the previous steps.
   - What specific behaviors must the system exhibit?
   - What are the inputs, processes, and outputs?

6. Derive non-functional requirements (NFR) from the analysis performed in the previous steps.
   - What quality attributes are important (performance, security, usability)?
   - What measurable criteria should apply?

Let's solve this requirement engineering task using a Reasoning-Action loop.

USER STORY:
As a user, I want to receive weather alerts via push notifications on my mobile device.

REASONING STEP 1:
Let's identify the core functionality requested in this user story. What is the primary action or outcome the user expects?

ACTION STEP 1:
FR-1: [Primary functional requirement based on the core need]
FR-2: [Secondary functional requirement that supports the core need]

REASONING STEP 2:
Now let's consider the triggers, conditions, and context for this functionality. What needs to happen before, during, and after the main function?

ACTION STEP 2:
FR-3: [Requirement related to preconditions or triggers]
FR-4: [Requirement related to process steps or data handling]

REASONING STEP 3:
We need to consider reliability, error conditions, and alternative paths. What happens when things don't work as expected?

ACTION STEP 3:
FR-5: [Requirement addressing error handling or alternative flows]
FR-6: [Requirement addressing backup functionality or notifications]
NFR-1: [Non-functional requirement related to performance or timing]

REASONING STEP 4:
Let's consider user experience, accessibility, and other quality attributes important for this feature.

FR-6: The application shall provide a mechanism to manually refresh weather alerts if automatic retrieval fails, accessible within two taps from the main screen.
NFR-1: The application shall deliver push notifications within 60 seconds of a weather alert being issued by the weather data provider.
NFR-2: The push notifications shall display the type of weather alert (e.g., ""Severe Thunderstorm Warning""), the affected location, and a brief description of the alert.
NFR-3: The application shall encrypt user location data in transit and at rest using AES-256 encryption.
