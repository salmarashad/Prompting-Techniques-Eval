You are a Senior Requirements Engineer with 15 years of experience in software development. Your expertise is in translating business needs into technical specifications that bridge business goals and development work.

APPROACH THIS TASK AS A PROFESSIONAL WOULD:
- Consider system architecture implications
- Think about integration points with other systems
- Address security and compliance needs
- Consider maintenance and supportability

USER STORY:
As a user, I want to be able to save items to a wish list so that I can easily find them later.

Produce a set of professional-grade specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound requirements that would be ready for development team implementation. Include:
1. Numbered functional requirements (with FR prefix)
2. Numbered non-functional requirements (with NFR prefix)
3. Potential risks or dependencies

I want you to only share the functional (FR) and nonfunctional (NFR) requirements as follows and do not share your reasoning with me:

Let's solve this requirement engineering task using a Reasoning-Action loop.

USER STORY:
As a user, I want to be able to save items to a wish list so that I can easily find them later.

REASONING STEP 1:
Let's identify the core functionality requested in this user story. What is the primary action or outcome the user expects?

ACTION STEP 1:
FR-1: [Primary functional requirement based on the core need]
FR-2: [Secondary functional requirement that supports the core need]

REASONING STEP 2:
Now let's consider the triggers, conditions, and context for this functionality. What needs to happen before, during, and after the main function?

ACTION STEP 2:
FR-3: [Requirement related to preconditions or triggers]
FR-4: [Requirement related to process steps or data handling]

REASONING STEP 3:
We need to consider reliability, error conditions, and alternative paths. What happens when things don't work as expected?

ACTION STEP 3:
FR-5: [Requirement addressing error handling or alternative flows]
FR-6: [Requirement addressing backup functionality or notifications]
NFR-1: [Non-functional requirement related to performance or timing]

REASONING STEP 4:
Let's consider user experience, accessibility, and other quality attributes important for this feature.

ACTION STEP 4:
NFR-2: [Non-functional requirement related to user interface or experience]
NFR-3: [Non-functional requirement related to quality attributes like accessibility or security]

FINAL REQUIREMENTS:
[Comprehensive list of all requirements developed through the reasoning-action process]

I want you to only share the specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound functional (FR) and nonfunctional (NFR) requirements as follows and do not share your reasoning with me: :

and so on..
","FR-1: User shall be able to add items to a wish list from a product details page.
FR-2: The wish list shall persist between user sessions (e.g., after logging out and back in).
FR-3: The user must be logged in to add items to a wish list. If not logged in, the system shall prompt the user to log in or create an account before adding to the wish list.
FR-4: When an item is added to the wish list, the system shall display a confirmation message to the user. The confirmation message should include the item name and indicate successful addition to the wish list.
FR-5: If an item is already in the user's wish list, attempting to add it again shall display an error message to the user indicating that the item is already present.
FR-6: The system shall provide a visual indication (e.g., a badge) on the wish list icon displaying the number of items currently in the wish list.
NFR-1: Adding an item to the wish list shall take no longer than 2 seconds.
NFR-2: The wish list page shall be accessible and easily navigable using keyboard-only input.
NFR-3: The wish list feature shall comply with all applicable data privacy regulations regarding the storage and handling of user data.
