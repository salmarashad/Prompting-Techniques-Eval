As a user, I want to be able to easily reorder items that I have previously purchased.

Produce a set of professional-grade specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound requirements that would be ready for development team implementation. Include:
1. Numbered functional requirements (with FR prefix)
2. Numbered non-functional requirements (with NFR prefix)
3. Potential risks or dependencies

","FR-1: The system shall allow users to view a list of their previously purchased items, ordered by purchase date (most recent first).
FR-2: The system shall allow users to add previously purchased items to their current shopping cart directly from the ""Order History"" or ""Past Purchases"" section.
FR-3: The user must be logged in to access the ""Order History"" or ""Past Purchases"" section.
FR-4: The system shall display the quantity of each item purchased in the past, allowing the user to select the desired quantity to add to the cart, up to the maximum previously purchased.
FR-5: If an item is no longer available for purchase, the system shall display a message indicating its unavailability, and prevent the user from adding it to the cart.
FR-6: The system shall provide a confirmation message to the user upon successfully adding items from a previous order to the current shopping cart.
NFR-1: The ""Order History"" or ""Past Purchases"" section shall load within 3 seconds.
NFR-2: The ""Order History"" or ""Past Purchases"" section shall be easily navigable using keyboard-only navigation.
NFR-3: The ""Order History"" or ""Past Purchases"" section shall adhere to WCAG 2.1 Level AA accessibility guidelines.

Let's solve this requirement engineering task using a Reasoning-Action loop.

USER STORY:
As a user, I want to be able to easily reorder items that I have previously purchased.

REASONING STEP 1:
Let's identify the core functionality requested in this user story. What is the primary action or outcome the user expects?

ACTION STEP 1:
FR-1: [Primary functional requirement based on the core need]
FR-2: [Secondary functional requirement that supports the core need]

REASONING STEP 2:
Now let's consider the triggers, conditions, and context for this functionality. What needs to happen before, during, and after the main function?

ACTION STEP 2:
FR-3: [Requirement related to preconditions or triggers]
FR-4: [Requirement related to process steps or data handling]

REASONING STEP 3:
We need to consider reliability, error conditions, and alternative paths. What happens when things don't work as expected?

ACTION STEP 3:
FR-5: [Requirement addressing error handling or alternative flows]
FR-6: [Requirement addressing backup functionality or notifications]
NFR-1: [Non-functional requirement related to performance or timing]

REASONING STEP 4:
Let's consider user experience, accessibility, and other quality attributes important for this feature.

ACTION STEP 4:
NFR-2: [Non-functional requirement related to user interface or experience]
NFR-3: [Non-functional requirement related to quality attributes like accessibility or security]

FR-6: The system shall provide a confirmation message upon successfully adding items to the cart.

NFR-1: The list of previously purchased items shall load within 3 seconds.

NFR-2: The reordering interface shall be intuitive and easy to navigate on both desktop and mobile devices.
