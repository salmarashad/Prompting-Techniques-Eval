Each cell should display the date and a summary of events scheduled for that day (e.g., event title or a count of events).
*   **FR-5: Navigation:** The system shall allow the user to navigate to the previous and next day/week/month (depending on the selected view) using navigation controls (e.g., arrow buttons, date picker).
*   **FR-6: Event Details:** The system shall allow the user to view the complete details of an event by clicking on the event in any view (Day, Week, or Month). The event details should include the event title, start time, end time, description, location, and attendees.
*   **FR-7: Data Source:** The calendar views shall display data retrieved from the user's personal calendar data store.
*   **FR-8: Default View:** The system shall default to displaying the ""Day"" view upon initial calendar load, or retain the view selected during the user's previous session.

**Non-Functional Requirements (NFR):**

*   **NFR-1: View Loading Time:** The system shall load the ""Day,"" ""Week,"" or ""Month"" view within 2 seconds under normal load conditions (defined as up to 100 concurrent users).
*   **NFR-2: Responsiveness:** The system shall respond to user interactions (e.g., view selection, navigation) within 0.5 seconds.
*   **NFR-3: Data Security:** The system shall ensure that only the authenticated user can view their personal calendar data.
*   **NFR-4: Accessibility:** The calendar views shall be designed to be accessible to users with disabilities, adhering to WCAG 2.1 Level AA guidelines. This includes providing alternative text for images, ensuring sufficient color contrast, and supporting keyboard navigation.
*   **NFR-5: Scalability:** The system shall be able to handle up to 10,000 concurrent users without significant degradation in performance.

**Explanation of Choices and Considerations:**

*   **Specificity:** The requirements are specific about what the system should do.  For example, FR-2 details what information should be displayed in the Day view.
*   **Measurability:** The NFRs include measurable performance targets (e.g., loading times).
*   **Achievability:** The requirements are generally achievable with modern web development technologies.
*   **Relevance:** The requirements directly address the user's need to easily view their schedule in different formats.
*   **Time-Bound:** The NFRs include performance targets that can be measured within a specific timeframe.
*   **Testability:** Each requirement is written in a way that it can be verified through testing.  For example, you can test that the system loads the Day view within 2 seconds.

This refined list gives developers a clear understanding of what needs to be built and how the system should perform. Remember to tailor these requirements further based on the specific context and constraints of your project.

Let's solve this requirement engineering task using a Reasoning-Action loop.

USER STORY:
As a user, I want to be able to view my personal calendar by day, week, or month, so that I can easily see my schedule.

REASONING STEP 1:
Let's identify the core functionality requested in this user story. What is the primary action or outcome the user expects?

ACTION STEP 1:
FR-1: [Primary functional requirement based on the core need]
FR-2: [Secondary functional requirement that supports the core need]

REASONING STEP 2:
Now let's consider the triggers, conditions, and context for this functionality. What needs to happen before, during, and after the main function?

ACTION STEP 2:
FR-3: [Requirement related to preconditions or triggers]
FR-4: [Requirement related to process steps or data handling]

REASONING STEP 3:
We need to consider reliability, error conditions, and alternative paths. What happens when things don't work as expected?

ACTION STEP 3:
FR-5: [Requirement addressing error handling or alternative flows]
FR-6: [Requirement addressing backup functionality or notifications]
NFR-1: [Non-functional requirement related to performance or timing]

REASONING STEP 4:
Let's consider user experience, accessibility, and other quality attributes important for this feature.

ACTION STEP 4:
NFR-2: [Non-functional requirement related to user interface or experience]
NFR-3: [Non-functional requirement related to quality attributes like accessibility or security]

FINAL REQUIREMENTS:
[Comprehensive list of all requirements developed through the reasoning-action process]

I want you to only share the specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound functional (FR) and nonfunctional (NFR) requirements as follows and do not share your reasoning with me: : 

FR-1: 
FR-2:
NFR-1: 
NFR-2:
and so on..
","FR-1: The system shall allow the user to view their calendar in a daily view.
FR-2: The system shall allow the user to view their calendar in a weekly view.
FR-3: The system shall require the user to be authenticated before viewing their calendar.
FR-4: The system shall retrieve and display calendar events from the user's associated account.
FR-5: The system shall display an error message if calendar events cannot be retrieved, prompting the user to retry or contact support.
FR-6: The system shall provide a visual cue (e.g., loading animation) while retrieving calendar events.
NFR-1: The calendar shall load within 2 seconds of the user selecting a day, week, or month view.
NFR-2: The calendar views shall be intuitive and easy to navigate, with clear visual separation between events.
NFR-3: The calendar shall be accessible to users with disabilities, adhering to WCAG 2.1 Level AA guidelines.
