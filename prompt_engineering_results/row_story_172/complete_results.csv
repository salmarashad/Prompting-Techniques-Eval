You are a Senior Requirements Engineer with 15 years of experience in software development. Your expertise is in translating business needs into technical specifications that bridge business goals and development work.

APPROACH THIS TASK AS A PROFESSIONAL WOULD:
- Consider system architecture implications
- Think about integration points with other systems
- Address security and compliance needs
- Consider maintenance and supportability

USER STORY:
As a user, I want to be able to save my shopping cart for later.

Produce a set of professional-grade specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound requirements that would be ready for development team implementation. Include:
1. Numbered functional requirements (with FR prefix)
2. Numbered non-functional requirements (with NFR prefix)
3. Potential risks or dependencies

I want you to only share the functional (FR) and nonfunctional (NFR) requirements as follows and do not share your reasoning with me:

and so on..
","Here are the functional and non-functional requirements for the ""Save Shopping Cart"" user story, formatted for development team implementation:

FR-1: The system shall provide a ""Save Cart"" button/link on the shopping cart page.

FR-2: Upon clicking ""Save Cart,"" the system shall persist all items in the user's current shopping cart, including quantity and any applied options (e.g., size, color).

FR-3: The system shall associate the saved cart with the user's account. If the user is not logged in, the system shall prompt them to log in or create an account before saving the cart. Anonymous users will be required to create an account to save a cart.

FR-4: The system shall allow users to retrieve their saved cart(s) upon logging in.

FR-5: The system shall display a list of saved carts (if multiple exist) associated with the user’s account in a dedicated section (e.g., ""Saved Carts"" in the account dashboard).

FR-6: For each saved cart, the system shall display a summary including the date/time the cart was saved, the number of items in the cart, and the total cart value.

FR-7: The system shall provide an option to ""Load Cart"" for each saved cart. Loading a cart shall add the items from the saved cart to the user's current shopping cart, merging with any existing items in the cart (handling quantity appropriately if items already exist).

FR-8: The system shall provide an option to ""Delete Cart"" for each saved cart. Deleting a cart shall permanently remove the saved cart data from the system.

FR-9: The system shall limit the number of saved carts per user to a maximum of 5.

FR-10: When a user adds an item to their cart from the product page, the system shall automatically remove the item from all of the user's saved carts.

NFR-1: The ""Save Cart"" operation shall complete within 2 seconds under normal load (defined as up to 100 concurrent save requests per second).

NFR-2: The retrieval of saved carts shall complete within 3 seconds under normal load (defined as up to 100 concurrent retrieval requests per second).

NFR-3: The system shall ensure that saved cart data is stored securely, protecting against unauthorized access and modification, complying with all relevant data privacy regulations (e.g., GDPR, CCPA).

NFR-4: The system shall maintain an audit log of all ""Save Cart,"" ""Load Cart,"" and ""Delete Cart"" operations, including the user ID, timestamp, and cart ID.

NFR-5: The system shall be designed to handle at least 10,000 saved carts concurrently without performance degradation.

NFR-6: The system shall be compatible with the latest versions of Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge browsers.

NFR-7: The saved cart functionality shall be implemented in a manner that minimizes impact on the existing shopping cart and product catalog services.

NFR-8: The ""Save Cart"" feature shall be accessible and usable by users with disabilities, adhering to WCAG 2.1 Level AA accessibility guidelines.
