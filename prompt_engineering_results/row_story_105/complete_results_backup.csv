Convert the following user story into specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound software requirements by following these steps:

USER STORY:
As a user, I want to be able to easily search for available parking spots in my desired location and time period.

Follow these steps to derive the requirements:

1. Identify the actor (Who is performing the action?)
   - Who is the primary user in this story?
   - What is their role in the system?

2. Identify the action (What do they want to do?)
   - What specific functionality is being requested?
   - What system components would be involved?

3. Identify the goal (Why do they want to do it?)
   - What is the underlying user need?
   - How does this relate to business objectives?

4. Extract assumptions and constraints
   - What implicit needs are not directly stated?
   - What technical or business constraints might apply?

5. Derive detailed functional requirements (FR) from the analysis performed in the previous steps.
   - What specific behaviors must the system exhibit?
   - What are the inputs, processes, and outputs?

6. Derive non-functional requirements (NFR) from the analysis performed in the previous steps.
   - What quality attributes are important (performance, security, usability)?
   - What measurable criteria should apply?

Based on the analysis performed in the steps above, provide a numbered list of clear, specific, and testable functional (FR) and non-functional (NFR) requirements.

Output ONLY the functional (FR) and non-functional (NFR) requirements in the following format and do not share your reasoning with me:

","Okay, here are three sets of SMART requirements, followed by an evaluation and final recommendation.

**APPROACH 1: Focus on technical implementation details**

FR-1: The system shall provide a search endpoint `/api/parking/search` accepting location (latitude, longitude), radius (in meters), start time (ISO 8601 format), and end time (ISO 8601 format) as parameters.

NFR-3: The database queries must be optimized to minimize database load.

**APPROACH 2: Focus on user experience and outcomes**

FR-1: The user shall be able to enter a location using a text field that supports address auto-completion.
FR-2: The user shall be able to specify a start and end time using a date and time picker.

Approach 1 is very technically focused, which can be helpful for developers but doesn't directly address the user's needs. It's strong on testability due to the specific API details.

Approach 2 focuses on the user experience, specifying how the user interacts with the system. It's strong on alignment with the user story and has good testability.

Approach 3 focuses on the business logic and data flow, ensuring the system adheres to specific rules and handles data correctly. It's important for data integrity but may not be immediately apparent to the user.

**FINAL RECOMMENDATION**

I think approach 2 is the most effective set of requirements:

FR-1: The user shall be able to enter a location using a text field that supports address auto-completion.
FR-2: The user shall be able to specify a start and end time using a date and time picker.
FR-3: The search results shall display available parking spots on a map with visual markers.

Let's solve this requirement engineering task using a Reasoning-Action loop.

USER STORY:
As a user, I want to be able to easily search for available parking spots in my desired location and time period.

REASONING STEP 1:
Let's identify the core functionality requested in this user story. What is the primary action or outcome the user expects?

ACTION STEP 1:
FR-1: [Primary functional requirement based on the core need]
FR-2: [Secondary functional requirement that supports the core need]

REASONING STEP 2:
Now let's consider the triggers, conditions, and context for this functionality. What needs to happen before, during, and after the main function?

ACTION STEP 2:
FR-3: [Requirement related to preconditions or triggers]
FR-4: [Requirement related to process steps or data handling]

REASONING STEP 3:
We need to consider reliability, error conditions, and alternative paths. What happens when things don't work as expected?

ACTION STEP 3:
FR-5: [Requirement addressing error handling or alternative flows]
FR-6: [Requirement addressing backup functionality or notifications]
NFR-1: [Non-functional requirement related to performance or timing]

REASONING STEP 4:
Let's consider user experience, accessibility, and other quality attributes important for this feature.

ACTION STEP 4:
NFR-2: [Non-functional requirement related to user interface or experience]
NFR-3: [Non-functional requirement related to quality attributes like accessibility or security]

FR-2: The system shall display a list of available parking spots that match the search criteria, including their location, price (if applicable), and any relevant restrictions (e.g., maximum vehicle size).
FR-3: The system shall require users to be logged in or provide a valid guest account before initiating a parking spot search.
FR-4: The system shall retrieve parking spot availability data from a database or external API and update the displayed results in real-time (within 5 seconds).
FR-5: The system shall display an error message to the user if no parking spots are found matching the search criteria, suggesting alternative locations or time periods.
FR-6: The system shall provide a notification to the user if a previously unavailable parking spot becomes available within their specified search criteria (optional, user configurable).
NFR-1: The system shall return search results within 3 seconds for 95% of searches.
NFR-2: The search interface shall be intuitive and easy to use on both desktop and mobile devices, with clear labels and instructions.
NFR-3: The system shall protect user location data and search history using encryption and access controls, complying with relevant privacy regulations (e.g., GDPR).
