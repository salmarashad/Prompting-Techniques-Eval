Let's solve this requirement engineering task using a Reasoning-Action loop.

USER STORY:
As a user, I want to be able to view properties in a virtual tour so that I can get a better sense of their layout and features before visiting in person.

REASONING STEP 1:
Let's identify the core functionality requested in this user story. What is the primary action or outcome the user expects?

ACTION STEP 1:
FR-1: [Primary functional requirement based on the core need]
FR-2: [Secondary functional requirement that supports the core need]

REASONING STEP 2:
Now let's consider the triggers, conditions, and context for this functionality. What needs to happen before, during, and after the main function?

ACTION STEP 2:
FR-3: [Requirement related to preconditions or triggers]
FR-4: [Requirement related to process steps or data handling]

REASONING STEP 3:
We need to consider reliability, error conditions, and alternative paths. What happens when things don't work as expected?

ACTION STEP 3:
FR-5: [Requirement addressing error handling or alternative flows]
FR-6: [Requirement addressing backup functionality or notifications]
NFR-1: [Non-functional requirement related to performance or timing]

REASONING STEP 4:
Let's consider user experience, accessibility, and other quality attributes important for this feature.

ACTION STEP 4:
NFR-2: [Non-functional requirement related to user interface or experience]
NFR-3: [Non-functional requirement related to quality attributes like accessibility or security]

FINAL REQUIREMENTS:

","FR-1: The system shall display a navigable 360-degree virtual tour of a property.
FR-2: The system shall allow users to zoom in and out within the virtual tour.
FR-3: The virtual tour shall be accessible after a user selects the ""View Virtual Tour"" option on a property details page.
FR-4: The system shall load the virtual tour within 5 seconds of the ""View Virtual Tour"" option being selected.
FR-5: If the virtual tour fails to load, the system shall display an error message indicating the virtual tour is unavailable and provide a contact link for support.
FR-6: If the virtual tour is unavailable, the system shall offer a fallback option to view a set of still images of the property.
NFR-1: The virtual tour shall load and become interactive within 5 seconds on a broadband internet connection (minimum 25 Mbps download speed).
NFR-2: The virtual tour interface shall be intuitive and easy to navigate using mouse, keyboard, and touch screen controls.
NFR-3: The virtual tour shall be accessible to users with disabilities, adhering to WCAG 2.1 Level AA guidelines, including providing alternative text for interactive elements.
