**Functional Requirements (FR)**

*   **FR-1: Category Display:** The system shall display a list of grocery categories (e.g., Fruits, Vegetables, Dairy Products, Meat, Bakery, Pantry, Frozen Foods, Beverages).
*   **FR-2: Category Navigation:** The system shall allow users to navigate to a specific category by clicking or tapping on its displayed name or icon.
*   **FR-3: Category Item Listing:** When a user navigates to a category, the system shall display a list of grocery items belonging to that category.
*   **FR-4: Item Information:** For each item displayed, the system shall show at least the item name, a thumbnail image, and the price (per unit or weight).
*   **FR-5: Add to Cart Functionality:** Each item displayed shall have an ""Add to Cart"" button or similar interactive element.
*   **FR-6: Add to Cart Action:** When the ""Add to Cart"" button is pressed, the system shall add one unit of that item to the user's shopping cart.
*   **FR-7: Quantity Selection (Optional):** The system shall allow the user to specify the quantity of the item to add to the cart directly from the category listing page.
*   **FR-8: Cart Update Notification:** When an item is added to the cart, the system shall provide visual feedback to the user (e.g., a success message, a change in the cart icon/number, or highlighting the added item).
*   **FR-9: Search Functionality:** The system shall provide a search bar to allow users to search for specific grocery items across all categories. The search results will be displayed in a similar manner to category item listings.

**Non-Functional Requirements (NFR)**

*   **NFR-1: Category Load Time:** The system shall load a category's item listing within 2 seconds under normal load conditions.
*   **NFR-2: Image Optimization:** Thumbnail images for grocery items shall be optimized for fast loading and minimal bandwidth consumption.
*   **NFR-3: Responsiveness:** The category browsing and add-to-cart functionality shall be responsive and function correctly across different screen sizes (desktop, tablet, mobile).
*   **NFR-4: Accessibility:** The category browsing interface shall adhere to accessibility guidelines (e.g., WCAG) to ensure usability for users with disabilities.
*   **NFR-5: Scalability:** The system shall be able to handle at least 10,000 concurrent users browsing categories and adding items to their carts without significant performance degradation.
*   **NFR-6: Search Response Time:** Search results shall be displayed within 3 seconds of the user initiating a search.
*   **NFR-7: Item Display Consistency:** The item information (name, image, price) shall be displayed consistently across all categories and search results.
*   **NFR-8: Security:** The system shall protect against unauthorized access to grocery item data and prevent malicious manipulation of item listings.

**Explanation of Choices & Considerations:**

*   **Specificity:** The requirements are very specific about *what* the system must do.
*   **Measurability:** The non-functional requirements include measurable performance targets (e.g., load times).
*   **Achievability:** The requirements are realistic and achievable within a reasonable development effort.
*   **Relevance:** The requirements directly address the user's need to browse and add items to their cart.
*   **Time-Bound:** While not explicitly time-bound in the requirements themselves, the NFRs imply deadlines for performance (e.g., load times). The overall project will have a deadline.
*   **Functional vs. Non-Functional:** The separation clearly distinguishes between what the system *does* (functional) and *how well* it does it (non-functional).
*   **Completeness:** The list covers the main aspects of the user story, but could be expanded depending on the specific project context. I've included an optional FR for quantity selection, as this enhances the browsing experience.
*   **Context-Aware:** The specific categories listed in FR-1 are examples and should be replaced with the actual categories relevant to the grocery store in question.
*   **Scalability and Security:** These are important NFRs to consider for any e-commerce application.
*   **Accessibility:** Making the interface accessible is crucial for inclusivity.

This detailed breakdown provides a solid foundation for developers to implement the functionality described in the user story. Remember to refine these requirements further with stakeholders during the development process.

Convert the following user story into specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound software requirements by following these steps:

USER STORY:
As a user, I want to be able to easily browse through different categories of groceries such as fruits, vegetables, dairy products, etc. and add items to my cart.

Follow these steps to derive the requirements:

1. Identify the actor (Who is performing the action?)
   - Who is the primary user in this story?
   - What is their role in the system?

2. Identify the action (What do they want to do?)
   - What specific functionality is being requested?
   - What system components would be involved?

3. Identify the goal (Why do they want to do it?)
   - What is the underlying user need?
   - How does this relate to business objectives?

4. Extract assumptions and constraints
   - What implicit needs are not directly stated?
   - What technical or business constraints might apply?

5. Derive detailed functional requirements (FR) from the analysis performed in the previous steps.
   - What specific behaviors must the system exhibit?
   - What are the inputs, processes, and outputs?

6. Derive non-functional requirements (NFR) from the analysis performed in the previous steps.
   - What quality attributes are important (performance, security, usability)?
   - What measurable criteria should apply?

Based on the analysis performed in the steps above, provide a numbered list of clear, specific, and testable functional (FR) and non-functional (NFR) requirements.

Output ONLY the functional (FR) and non-functional (NFR) requirements in the following format and do not share your reasoning with me:

Let's solve this requirement engineering task using a Reasoning-Action loop.

USER STORY:
As a user, I want to be able to easily browse through different categories of groceries such as fruits, vegetables, dairy products, etc. and add items to my cart.

REASONING STEP 1:
Let's identify the core functionality requested in this user story. What is the primary action or outcome the user expects?

ACTION STEP 1:
FR-1: [Primary functional requirement based on the core need]
FR-2: [Secondary functional requirement that supports the core need]

REASONING STEP 2:
Now let's consider the triggers, conditions, and context for this functionality. What needs to happen before, during, and after the main function?

ACTION STEP 2:
FR-3: [Requirement related to preconditions or triggers]
FR-4: [Requirement related to process steps or data handling]

REASONING STEP 3:
We need to consider reliability, error conditions, and alternative paths. What happens when things don't work as expected?

ACTION STEP 3:
FR-5: [Requirement addressing error handling or alternative flows]
FR-6: [Requirement addressing backup functionality or notifications]
NFR-1: [Non-functional requirement related to performance or timing]

REASONING STEP 4:
Let's consider user experience, accessibility, and other quality attributes important for this feature.
