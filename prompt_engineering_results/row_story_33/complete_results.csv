Let's solve this requirement engineering task using a Reasoning-Action loop.

USER STORY:
As a user, I want to receive weather alerts that are accessible and user-friendly for people with disabilities.

REASONING STEP 1:
Let's identify the core functionality requested in this user story. What is the primary action or outcome the user expects?

ACTION STEP 1:
FR-1: [Primary functional requirement based on the core need]
FR-2: [Secondary functional requirement that supports the core need]

REASONING STEP 2:
Now let's consider the triggers, conditions, and context for this functionality. What needs to happen before, during, and after the main function?

ACTION STEP 2:
FR-3: [Requirement related to preconditions or triggers]
FR-4: [Requirement related to process steps or data handling]

REASONING STEP 3:
We need to consider reliability, error conditions, and alternative paths. What happens when things don't work as expected?

ACTION STEP 3:
FR-5: [Requirement addressing error handling or alternative flows]
FR-6: [Requirement addressing backup functionality or notifications]
NFR-1: [Non-functional requirement related to performance or timing]

REASONING STEP 4:
Let's consider user experience, accessibility, and other quality attributes important for this feature.

ACTION STEP 4:
NFR-2: [Non-functional requirement related to user interface or experience]
NFR-3: [Non-functional requirement related to quality attributes like accessibility or security]

FR-3: The system shall require users to configure their accessibility preferences (e.g., screen reader compatibility, font size, color contrast) upon initial setup.
FR-4: The system shall store user preferences for location and accessibility settings securely.
FR-5: The system shall provide alternative alert delivery methods (e.g., SMS, email) if the primary method (e.g., push notification) fails.
FR-6: The system shall notify the user if weather alert delivery is interrupted due to technical issues, within 5 minutes of the interruption.
NFR-1: The system shall deliver weather alerts within 2 minutes of the alert being issued by the weather service.
NFR-2: The user interface shall conform to WCAG 2.1 Level AA accessibility standards.
NFR-3: The system shall provide alerts in multiple formats, including text, audio, and visual representations, to cater to different user needs.
