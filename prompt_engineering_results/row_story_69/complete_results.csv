*   Approach 3: Clear, but assumes knowledge of the CMS and data handling processes.

**Testability:**

*   Approach 1: Highly testable due to specific technical requirements.
*   Approach 2: Testable, but requires defining ""intuitive controls"" and ""consistent look and feel"" more precisely.
*   Approach 3: Testable, but requires access to the CMS and understanding of data consistency rules.

**Feasibility:**

*   Approach 1: Feasible, assuming the team has the necessary technical skills.
*   Approach 2: Feasible, but requires careful design and user testing.
*   Approach 3: Feasible, assuming the CMS API is available and well-documented.

**Alignment:**

*   Approach 1: Partially aligned, focuses on the technical aspect of accessing news.
*   Approach 2: Highly aligned, focuses on the user's ability to access and read news.
*   Approach 3: Partially aligned, focuses on the data and business rules behind accessing news.
