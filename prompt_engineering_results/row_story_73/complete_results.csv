","Okay, here's a breakdown of the provided user story into specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound (SMART) functional and non-functional software requirements:

**User Story:** As a freelancer, I want to be able to manage my own tasks and deadlines, so that I can stay organized and meet my clients' expectations.

**Requirements:**

**Functional Requirements (FR):**

*   **FR-1:** The system shall provide a task management interface where the freelancer can create new tasks.
*   **FR-2:** The system shall allow the freelancer to assign a due date and time to each task.
*   **FR-3:** The system shall allow the freelancer to add a detailed description to each task, with a maximum of 500 characters.
*   **FR-4:** The system shall provide a visual representation of task progress, including options to mark tasks as ""To Do,"" ""In Progress,"" ""Completed,"" or ""Blocked.""
*   **FR-5:** The system shall allow the freelancer to categorize tasks by client, with an option to create new client categories.
*   **FR-6:** The system shall enable the freelancer to set reminders for tasks, configurable for up to 7 days before the due date in 1-day increments.
*   **FR-7:** The system shall display tasks in a sortable list by due date, client, or status.
*   **FR-8:** The system shall allow the freelancer to edit or delete existing tasks.
*   **FR-9:** The system shall allow the freelancer to set a priority level for each task (High, Medium, Low).
*   **FR-10:** The system shall support the uploading of files to tasks, up to 5 files with a maximum size of 10MB each.

**Non-Functional Requirements (NFR):**

*   **NFR-1:** The task management interface shall load within 2 seconds under normal load conditions (defined as up to 5 concurrent users).
*   **NFR-2:** The system shall send email reminders for upcoming tasks, at least 2 hours before the scheduled reminder time, with a 99.9% success rate.
*   **NFR-3:** The system shall store task data securely, with daily backups to an offsite location.
*   **NFR-4:** The task management interface shall be accessible and responsive on desktop and mobile devices (screen sizes 320px to 1920px).
*   **NFR-5:** The system shall maintain the integrity of task data even during unexpected system failures, with a maximum data loss of 1 minute.
*   **NFR-6:** The user interface shall be intuitive and easy to use, requiring no more than 15 minutes of training for new users to understand the basic functionality. This will be measured by conducting usability tests with at least 5 freelancers who have never used the system before.
*   **NFR-7:** The system shall adhere to accessibility guidelines (WCAG 2.1 Level AA).

**Explanation of Choices and Considerations:**

*   **Specificity:**  The requirements are specific about what the system *must* do.
*   **Measurability:**  There are quantifiable metrics (e.g., time to load, maximum file size, success rate) that can be used to verify if the requirements are met.
*   **Achievability:**  The requirements are realistic and technically feasible.
*   **Relevance:**  The requirements directly address the freelancer's need to manage tasks and deadlines effectively.
*   **Time-bound:**  While the requirements themselves are not strictly time-bound, they imply the system should function within a reasonable timeframe (e.g., loading times, reminder delivery).  Future iterations could include specific deadlines for implementing certain features.
*   **Detailed and Comprehensive:** The set of requirements aims to address most key needs that would come from the user story.

**Key Improvements over simpler examples:**

*   **More Concrete Actions:** The requirements go beyond general statements and specify actions the system *must* allow (e.g., ""assign a due date,"" ""add a description"").
*   **Constraints and Limits:**  Limits are defined (e.g., character limits on descriptions, maximum file sizes) to prevent unbounded scope.
*   **Error Handling (Implied):** While not explicitly stated in every case, the NFRs related to data integrity and email delivery imply the system must handle errors gracefully.
*   **Measurable Success:**  The NFRs include metrics that allow for clear verification that the requirements have been met (e.g. NFR-6 outlines a usability test).

This detailed breakdown provides a solid foundation for developers to build a task management system that meets the needs of freelancers.

Convert the following user story into specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound software requirements by following these steps:

USER STORY:
As a freelancer, I want to be able to manage my own tasks and deadlines, so that I can stay organized and meet my clients' expectations.

Follow these steps to derive the requirements:

1. Identify the actor (Who is performing the action?)
   - Who is the primary user in this story?
   - What is their role in the system?

2. Identify the action (What do they want to do?)
   - What specific functionality is being requested?
   - What system components would be involved?

3. Identify the goal (Why do they want to do it?)
   - What is the underlying user need?
   - How does this relate to business objectives?

4. Extract assumptions and constraints
   - What implicit needs are not directly stated?
   - What technical or business constraints might apply?

5. Derive detailed functional requirements (FR) from the analysis performed in the previous steps.
   - What specific behaviors must the system exhibit?
   - What are the inputs, processes, and outputs?

6. Derive non-functional requirements (NFR) from the analysis performed in the previous steps.
   - What quality attributes are important (performance, security, usability)?
   - What measurable criteria should apply?

Based on the analysis performed in the steps above, provide a numbered list of clear, specific, and testable functional (FR) and non-functional (NFR) requirements.

As a freelancer, I want to be able to manage my own tasks and deadlines, so that I can stay organized and meet my clients' expectations.

REASONING STEP 1:
Let's identify the core functionality requested in this user story. What is the primary action or outcome the user expects?

ACTION STEP 1:
FR-1: [Primary functional requirement based on the core need]
FR-2: [Secondary functional requirement that supports the core need]

REASONING STEP 2:
