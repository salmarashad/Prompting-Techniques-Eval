Let's identify the core functionality requested in this user story. What is the primary action or outcome the user expects?

ACTION STEP 1:
FR-1: [Primary functional requirement based on the core need]
FR-2: [Secondary functional requirement that supports the core need]

REASONING STEP 2:
Now let's consider the triggers, conditions, and context for this functionality. What needs to happen before, during, and after the main function?

ACTION STEP 2:
FR-3: [Requirement related to preconditions or triggers]
FR-4: [Requirement related to process steps or data handling]

REASONING STEP 3:
We need to consider reliability, error conditions, and alternative paths. What happens when things don't work as expected?

ACTION STEP 3:
FR-5: [Requirement addressing error handling or alternative flows]
FR-6: [Requirement addressing backup functionality or notifications]
NFR-1: [Non-functional requirement related to performance or timing]

REASONING STEP 4:
Let's consider user experience, accessibility, and other quality attributes important for this feature.

ACTION STEP 4:
NFR-2: [Non-functional requirement related to user interface or experience]
NFR-3: [Non-functional requirement related to quality attributes like accessibility or security]

FINAL REQUIREMENTS:
[Comprehensive list of all requirements developed through the reasoning-action process]

I want you to only share the specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound functional (FR) and nonfunctional (NFR) requirements as follows and do not share your reasoning with me: :

","FR-1: The system shall allow the homeowner to generate an invoice containing contractor details, service descriptions, material costs, labor costs, and total amount due.
FR-2: The system shall allow the homeowner to view a detailed breakdown of all repair services provided by the contractor.
FR-3: The system shall require the homeowner to have a completed service request associated with the contractor before generating an invoice.
FR-4: The system shall automatically calculate the total amount due based on the sum of material costs and labor costs entered by the contractor.
FR-5: The system shall display an error message if any required fields for the invoice (e.g., service description, cost) are missing.
FR-6: The system shall send a notification to both the homeowner and the contractor upon invoice generation.
NFR-1: The system shall generate the invoice within 5 seconds of the homeowner's request.
NFR-2: The invoice generation interface shall be intuitive and easy to navigate for users with varying levels of technical expertise.
NFR-3: The system shall ensure that all invoice data is stored securely and protected from unauthorized access.

","FR-1: The system shall generate an invoice in a printable and downloadable format (e.g., PDF) containing a unique invoice number, date, homeowner's name and address, contractor's name and address, a detailed list of repair services performed, the cost of each service, total cost, and payment due date.

FR-2: The system shall allow the homeowner to preview the generated invoice before finalizing and downloading it.

FR-3: The system shall require a record of completed repair services, including date of service, description of work, and associated costs, to be present in the system before an invoice can be generated.

FR-4: The system shall automatically calculate the total cost based on the sum of individual service costs.

FR-5: The system shall display an error message and prevent invoice generation if any required information (e.g., cost of service) is missing or invalid in the repair services record.

FR-6: The system shall provide an audit log entry for each invoice generated, including the user who generated it and the date/time of generation.

NFR-1: The invoice generation process shall complete within 5 seconds.

NFR-2: The invoice preview shall be displayed in a clear and easy-to-read format, consistent with the application's overall user interface design.

NFR-3: The system shall ensure that only the homeowner or authorized personnel (e.g., contractor with permission) can access and generate invoices related to the homeowner's property.
