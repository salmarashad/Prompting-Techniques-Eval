*   **FR-8: Profile Saving:** The system shall save the user's personal information (name and profile picture) to their account after they submit the changes.

*   **FR-9: Display Profile:** The system shall display the user's name and profile picture on their profile page and in other areas of the application where their identity is represented (e.g., posts, comments).

*   **FR-10: Default Profile Picture:** The system shall assign a default profile picture to new users until they upload their own.

**Non-Functional Requirements:**

*   **NFR-1: Profile Save Performance:** The system shall save profile information (including image upload) within 5 seconds under normal load conditions (defined as up to 100 concurrent users performing profile updates).

*   **NFR-2: Image Storage:** The system shall store profile pictures securely and efficiently, optimizing storage space without significantly degrading image quality.

*   **NFR-3: Image Availability:** Profile pictures shall be available 99.9% of the time.

*   **NFR-4: Image Display Performance:** Profile pictures shall load and display within 2 seconds on a typical broadband connection.

*   **NFR-5: Security:** The system shall protect user profile information from unauthorized access and modification.

*   **NFR-6: Scalability:** The system shall be able to handle a growing number of users and profile pictures without significant performance degradation.

**Explanation of why these requirements are SMART (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-bound):**

*   **Specific:**  Each requirement clearly defines what the system *shall* do.  There's little room for interpretation.
*   **Measurable:** We can easily test whether each requirement is met.  For example, we can measure the time taken to save profile information or the maximum image size.
*   **Achievable:** These requirements are technically feasible with standard web development practices and technologies.
*   **Relevant:**  These requirements directly support the user's goal of adding personal information to their social media account.
*   **Time-bound:** Some requirements include specific time limits (e.g., ""within 5 seconds""). Others, while not explicitly time-bound, imply a reasonable expectation of performance and availability.

Let's solve this requirement engineering task using a Reasoning-Action loop.

USER STORY:
As a user, I want to be able to add my personal information to my social media account, such as my name and profile picture.

REASONING STEP 1:
Let's identify the core functionality requested in this user story. What is the primary action or outcome the user expects?

ACTION STEP 1:
FR-1: [Primary functional requirement based on the core need]
FR-2: [Secondary functional requirement that supports the core need]

REASONING STEP 2:
Now let's consider the triggers, conditions, and context for this functionality. What needs to happen before, during, and after the main function?

ACTION STEP 2:
FR-3: [Requirement related to preconditions or triggers]
FR-4: [Requirement related to process steps or data handling]

REASONING STEP 3:
We need to consider reliability, error conditions, and alternative paths. What happens when things don't work as expected?

ACTION STEP 3:
FR-5: [Requirement addressing error handling or alternative flows]
FR-6: [Requirement addressing backup functionality or notifications]
NFR-1: [Non-functional requirement related to performance or timing]

REASONING STEP 4:
Let's consider user experience, accessibility, and other quality attributes important for this feature.

ACTION STEP 4:
NFR-2: [Non-functional requirement related to user interface or experience]
NFR-3: [Non-functional requirement related to quality attributes like accessibility or security]

FINAL REQUIREMENTS:

","FR-1: The system shall allow the user to update their personal information, including name and profile picture.
FR-2: The system shall store the user's updated personal information persistently.
FR-3: The user must be logged in to their account before being able to access the profile update functionality.
FR-4: The system shall validate the format of the user's name (e.g., character limits, allowed characters) before saving.
FR-5: The system shall display an error message to the user if the profile picture upload fails (e.g., invalid file type, size limit exceeded).
FR-6: The system shall notify the user upon successful update of their profile information via an on-screen confirmation message.
NFR-1: The system shall update the user's profile information within 3 seconds of the user submitting the changes.
NFR-2: The profile update interface shall be intuitive and easy to navigate, adhering to established UI/UX guidelines for the social media platform.
NFR-3: The system shall ensure that the profile picture is stored securely and protected from unauthorized access.
