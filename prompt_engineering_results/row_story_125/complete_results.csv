FR-1: [Primary functional requirement based on the core need]
FR-2: [Secondary functional requirement that supports the core need]

REASONING STEP 2:
Now let's consider the triggers, conditions, and context for this functionality. What needs to happen before, during, and after the main function?

ACTION STEP 2:
FR-3: [Requirement related to preconditions or triggers]
FR-4: [Requirement related to process steps or data handling]

REASONING STEP 3:
We need to consider reliability, error conditions, and alternative paths. What happens when things don't work as expected?

ACTION STEP 3:
FR-5: [Requirement addressing error handling or alternative flows]
FR-6: [Requirement addressing backup functionality or notifications]
NFR-1: [Non-functional requirement related to performance or timing]

REASONING STEP 4:
Let's consider user experience, accessibility, and other quality attributes important for this feature.

ACTION STEP 4:
NFR-2: [Non-functional requirement related to user interface or experience]
NFR-3: [Non-functional requirement related to quality attributes like accessibility or security]

","FR-1: The system shall allow the project manager to assign resources (e.g., personnel, equipment) to tasks.
FR-2: The system shall track the assigned resources for each task, including the type and quantity of resources assigned.
FR-3: The system shall require that all resources are defined and available in the system before they can be assigned to a task.
FR-4: The system shall calculate the cost of resources assigned to a task based on pre-defined resource rates.
FR-5: The system shall prevent the assignment of resources exceeding available capacity.
FR-6: The system shall notify the project manager when a resource allocation exceeds a predefined budget threshold.
NFR-1: The system shall update resource allocation information within 5 seconds of the project manager's action.
NFR-2: The resource assignment interface shall be intuitive and easy to use, requiring minimal training for the project manager.
NFR-3: The system shall ensure that only authorized project managers can assign resources to tasks.

","FR-1: The system shall allow a project manager to assign one or more resources to a task.
FR-2: The system shall display a list of available resources (e.g., personnel, equipment) to the project manager.
FR-3: The system shall require the project manager to select a task before assigning resources.
FR-4: The system shall track the allocated time/effort of each resource assigned to a task.
FR-5: The system shall display an error message if the project manager attempts to assign a resource that is already fully allocated during the specified timeframe.
