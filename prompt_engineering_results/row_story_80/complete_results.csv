**User Story:** As a user, I want to be able to easily browse through my collection of e-books so that I can quickly find the book I want to read.

**Requirements:**

**Functional Requirements (FR):**

*   **FR-1: E-book Listing:** The system shall display a list of the user's e-books.
*   **FR-2: Title Display:** The system shall display the title of each e-book.
*   **FR-3: Author Display:** The system shall display the author of each e-book.
*   **FR-4: Cover Image Display (Optional):** The system shall optionally display the cover image of each e-book.
*   **FR-5: Sorting:** The system shall allow the user to sort the e-book list by title (ascending and descending) and author (ascending and descending).
*   **FR-6: Filtering by Author:** The system shall allow the user to filter the e-book list by author.
*   **FR-7: Filtering by Genre (Optional):** The system shall optionally allow the user to filter the e-book list by genre.
*   **FR-8: Search Functionality:** The system shall provide a search field that allows the user to search for e-books by title or author.
*   **FR-9: Pagination:** The system shall implement pagination for e-book lists exceeding 20 books, displaying 20 books per page.
*   **FR-10: Book Details:** Clicking on an e-book entry in the list shall navigate the user to a dedicated page displaying detailed information about the book (title, author, description, cover image (if available), etc.).

**Non-Functional Requirements (NFR):**

*   **NFR-1: Loading Time:** The e-book list shall load within 2 seconds for a collection of up to 100 e-books.
*   **NFR-2: Search Response Time:** Search results shall be displayed within 1 second after the user initiates a search.
*   **NFR-3: UI Responsiveness:** The user interface (UI) shall remain responsive during browsing and filtering operations.  Specifically, the UI should not freeze or become unresponsive for more than 0.5 seconds during these operations.
*   **NFR-4: Scalability:** The system should be able to handle a collection of up to 1000 e-books without significant performance degradation. (Define ""significant degradation"" - e.g., loading time increase of no more than 50%).
*   **NFR-5: Accessibility:** The e-book browsing interface shall be designed to be accessible to users with disabilities, adhering to WCAG 2.1 Level AA guidelines. (This implies considering things like screen reader compatibility, keyboard navigation, sufficient color contrast, etc.)
*   **NFR-6: Visual Clarity:** The e-book list shall be displayed in a clear and visually appealing manner, with sufficient spacing and font sizes to ensure readability.

**Explanation of Choices and Considerations:**

*   **Specificity:** Each requirement is focused on a specific aspect of the user story.
*   **Measurability:** The NFRs include measurable targets (e.g., loading times, response times, number of books).
*   **Achievability:** The targets are realistic and achievable with reasonable effort and technology.
*   **Relevance:** All requirements directly address the user's need to easily browse their e-book collection.
*   **Time-Bound:**  While not explicitly stated in each requirement, the implementation will have deadlines within the overall project timeline. The performance metrics (NFRs) also imply a time element.
*   **Functional vs. Non-Functional:** The requirements are clearly separated into functional aspects (what the system *does*) and non-functional aspects (how well it *performs*).
*   **Optional Features:** Some features (e.g., displaying cover images, filtering by genre) are marked as optional, indicating that they are desirable but not strictly essential for the core functionality.  This allows for prioritization during development.
*   **Scalability:** Addresses the need to handle growing collections of e-books.
*   **Accessibility:** Considers users with disabilities.
*   **Visual Clarity:**  Addresses the user's need for ""easy"" browsing by ensuring the interface is readable and visually appealing.

This detailed breakdown provides a solid foundation for developers to implement the e-book browsing functionality, ensuring that it meets the user's needs and expectations.

**FINAL RECOMMENDATION:**

**The most effective set of requirements is Approach 2.**

**Justification:**

While Approach 1 focuses on technical details and Approach 3 focuses on business rules, Approach 2 directly addresses the user story's core need: to *easily browse* and *quickly find* books.

Approach 2's requirements are more user-centric. They emphasize features like filtering, visual cover display, auto-suggest search, and custom collections, all of which contribute directly to a positive browsing experience. The NFRs in Approach 2 also focus on measurable user outcomes (finding a book within a specified time) and accessibility, which are important considerations for a well-designed application.

Let's solve this requirement engineering task using a Reasoning-Action loop.

USER STORY:
As a user, I want to be able to easily browse through my collection of e-books so that I can quickly find the book I want to read.

REASONING STEP 1:
Let's identify the core functionality requested in this user story. What is the primary action or outcome the user expects?

ACTION STEP 1:
FR-1: [Primary functional requirement based on the core need]
FR-2: [Secondary functional requirement that supports the core need]

REASONING STEP 2:
Now let's consider the triggers, conditions, and context for this functionality. What needs to happen before, during, and after the main function?

ACTION STEP 2:
FR-3: [Requirement related to preconditions or triggers]
FR-4: [Requirement related to process steps or data handling]

REASONING STEP 3:
We need to consider reliability, error conditions, and alternative paths. What happens when things don't work as expected?

ACTION STEP 3:
FR-5: [Requirement addressing error handling or alternative flows]
FR-6: [Requirement addressing backup functionality or notifications]
NFR-1: [Non-functional requirement related to performance or timing]

REASONING STEP 4:
Let's consider user experience, accessibility, and other quality attributes important for this feature.

ACTION STEP 4:
NFR-2: [Non-functional requirement related to user interface or experience]
NFR-3: [Non-functional requirement related to quality attributes like accessibility or security]

","FR-1: The system shall provide a browseable list of e-books, sortable by title, author, and date added.
FR-2: The system shall allow the user to filter the e-book list based on genre, author, and reading status (e.g., ""Read,"" ""Currently Reading,"" ""To Read"").
FR-3: The system shall require the user to be logged in before browsing the e-book collection.
FR-4: The system shall display e-book metadata (title, author, cover image) in the browseable list.
FR-5: The system shall display an error message to the user if the e-book collection cannot be loaded.
FR-6: The system shall provide a ""Refresh"" button to manually reload the e-book collection in case of loading errors.
NFR-1: The e-book list shall load within 3 seconds of the user navigating to the browsing page.
NFR-2: The e-book browsing interface shall be intuitive and easy to navigate, with clear visual cues for sorting and filtering.
NFR-3: The e-book browsing interface shall be accessible to users with screen readers and keyboard navigation.
