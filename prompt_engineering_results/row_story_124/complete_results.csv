Convert the following user story into specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound software requirements by following these steps:

USER STORY:
As a team member, I want to be able to communicate with other team members online so that we can collaborate effectively.

Follow these steps to derive the requirements:

1. Identify the actor (Who is performing the action?)
   - Who is the primary user in this story?
   - What is their role in the system?

2. Identify the action (What do they want to do?)
   - What specific functionality is being requested?
   - What system components would be involved?

3. Identify the goal (Why do they want to do it?)
   - What is the underlying user need?
   - How does this relate to business objectives?

4. Extract assumptions and constraints
   - What implicit needs are not directly stated?
   - What technical or business constraints might apply?

5. Derive detailed functional requirements (FR) from the analysis performed in the previous steps.
   - What specific behaviors must the system exhibit?
   - What are the inputs, processes, and outputs?

6. Derive non-functional requirements (NFR) from the analysis performed in the previous steps.
   - What quality attributes are important (performance, security, usability)?
   - What measurable criteria should apply?

Based on the analysis performed in the steps above, provide a numbered list of clear, specific, and testable functional (FR) and non-functional (NFR) requirements.

Output ONLY the functional (FR) and non-functional (NFR) requirements in the following format and do not share your reasoning with me:

**EVALUATION**

*   **Completeness:** Approach 1 is the least complete, focusing solely on technical details. Approach 2 covers user experience well, and Approach 3 focuses on data and business rules. No single approach fully covers every aspect of the user story.
*   **Clarity:** All three are reasonably clear, but Approach 2 and 3 use more user-friendly language.
*   **Testability:** All are testable, but Approach 2's NFR relies on a user survey, which can be subjective.
*   **Feasibility:** All seem feasible.
*   **Alignment:** Approach 2 best aligns with the ""collaborate effectively"" outcome stated in the user story.

**FINAL RECOMMENDATION**

The most effective set of requirements is a **combination of elements from all three approaches**, with a stronger emphasis on Approach 2. This is because Approach 2 prioritizes user experience and outcomes, directly addressing the user's need to collaborate effectively. However, the technical details and business rules from Approaches 1 and 3 are also necessary for a complete and functional system.

Here's a refined set of requirements incorporating the best aspects of each:

FR-1: Users shall be able to send and receive text messages in real-time.
FR-2: Users shall be able to see when other users are online.
FR-3: Users shall be able to search for past messages using keywords.
FR-4: The system shall enforce that all messages are associated with a team.

Now let's consider the triggers, conditions, and context for this functionality. What needs to happen before, during, and after the main function?

ACTION STEP 2:
FR-3: [Requirement related to preconditions or triggers]
FR-4: [Requirement related to process steps or data handling]

REASONING STEP 3:
We need to consider reliability, error conditions, and alternative paths. What happens when things don't work as expected?

ACTION STEP 3:
FR-5: [Requirement addressing error handling or alternative flows]
FR-6: [Requirement addressing backup functionality or notifications]
NFR-1: [Non-functional requirement related to performance or timing]

REASONING STEP 4:
Let's consider user experience, accessibility, and other quality attributes important for this feature.

ACTION STEP 4:
NFR-2: [Non-functional requirement related to user interface or experience]
NFR-3: [Non-functional requirement related to quality attributes like accessibility or security]

Let's solve this requirement engineering task using a Reasoning-Action loop.

USER STORY:
As a team member, I want to be able to communicate with other team members online so that we can collaborate effectively.

REASONING STEP 1:
Let's identify the core functionality requested in this user story. What is the primary action or outcome the user expects?

ACTION STEP 1:
FR-1: [Primary functional requirement based on the core need]
FR-2: [Secondary functional requirement that supports the core need]

REASONING STEP 2:
Now let's consider the triggers, conditions, and context for this functionality. What needs to happen before, during, and after the main function?

ACTION STEP 2:

","FR-1: Users must be able to send text-based messages to other users within the team.
FR-2: Users must be able to view a list of online team members.
FR-3: Users must authenticate with valid credentials before accessing the communication platform.
FR-4: The system must store message history for at least 30 days, searchable by keyword and sender/recipient.
FR-5: The system must display an error message to the user if a message fails to send and provide an option to retry.
FR-6: The system must provide notifications when new messages are received while the application is running in the background within 5 seconds.
NFR-1: The system must deliver messages to recipients within 2 seconds of sending, 99% of the time.
NFR-2: The user interface must be intuitive and easy to navigate, as measured by a System Usability Scale (SUS) score of at least 70 after a usability test with 5 users.
NFR-3: The system must use end-to-end encryption to ensure the confidentiality of messages in transit and at rest.
