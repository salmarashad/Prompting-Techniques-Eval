Follow these steps to derive the requirements:

1. Identify the actor (Who is performing the action?)
   - Who is the primary user in this story?
   - What is their role in the system?

2. Identify the action (What do they want to do?)
   - What specific functionality is being requested?
   - What system components would be involved?

3. Identify the goal (Why do they want to do it?)
   - What is the underlying user need?
   - How does this relate to business objectives?

4. Extract assumptions and constraints
   - What implicit needs are not directly stated?
   - What technical or business constraints might apply?

5. Derive detailed functional requirements (FR) from the analysis performed in the previous steps.
   - What specific behaviors must the system exhibit?
   - What are the inputs, processes, and outputs?

6. Derive non-functional requirements (NFR) from the analysis performed in the previous steps.
   - What quality attributes are important (performance, security, usability)?
   - What measurable criteria should apply?

Based on the analysis performed in the steps above, provide a numbered list of clear, specific, and testable functional (FR) and non-functional (NFR) requirements.

Output ONLY the functional (FR) and non-functional (NFR) requirements in the following format and do not share your reasoning with me:

FR-6: The system shall provide a ""Reset to Default"" option for playback settings, which sets the playback speed to 1.0x and the volume to 50.
NFR-1: Playback speed adjustments shall be applied within 0.2 seconds of the user changing the setting.
NFR-2: The playback settings controls (speed and volume) shall be easily accessible and clearly labeled on the playback screen.
NFR-3: The playback settings controls shall be compatible with screen readers and keyboard navigation for accessibility.

Let's solve this requirement engineering task using a Reasoning-Action loop.

USER STORY:
As a music listener, I want to be able to customize the playback settings, so that I can optimize the music listening experience.

REASONING STEP 1:
Let's identify the core functionality requested in this user story. What is the primary action or outcome the user expects?

ACTION STEP 1:
FR-1: [Primary functional requirement based on the core need]
FR-2: [Secondary functional requirement that supports the core need]

REASONING STEP 2:
Now let's consider the triggers, conditions, and context for this functionality. What needs to happen before, during, and after the main function?

ACTION STEP 2:
FR-3: [Requirement related to preconditions or triggers]
FR-4: [Requirement related to process steps or data handling]

REASONING STEP 3:
We need to consider reliability, error conditions, and alternative paths. What happens when things don't work as expected?

ACTION STEP 3:
FR-5: [Requirement addressing error handling or alternative flows]
FR-6: [Requirement addressing backup functionality or notifications]
NFR-1: [Non-functional requirement related to performance or timing]

REASONING STEP 4:
Let's consider user experience, accessibility, and other quality attributes important for this feature.

ACTION STEP 4:
NFR-2: [Non-functional requirement related to user interface or experience]
NFR-3: [Non-functional requirement related to quality attributes like accessibility or security]

FINAL REQUIREMENTS:
[Comprehensive list of all requirements developed through the reasoning-action process]

I want you to only share the specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound functional (FR) and nonfunctional (NFR) requirements as follows and do not share your reasoning with me: :

","FR-1: The system shall allow the user to adjust the playback speed of the music, with options ranging from 0.5x to 2.0x in increments of 0.1x.
FR-2: The system shall allow the user to adjust the volume level from 0 to 100 in increments of 1.
FR-3: The playback customization settings shall persist between application sessions for each user.
FR-4: The system shall display the current playback speed and volume level to the user in real-time as they are adjusted.
FR-5: If the system fails to load a custom setting, it shall revert to the default settings (playback speed 1.0x, volume 50) and display an error message to the user.
FR-6: The system shall include a button to reset all playback settings to their default values (playback speed 1.0x, volume 50).
NFR-1: The system shall apply playback speed and volume changes within 200 milliseconds of the user adjusting the settings.
NFR-2: The playback customization settings UI shall be accessible via keyboard navigation.
NFR-3: The volume control shall adhere to accessibility standards for users with visual impairments, providing ARIA attributes for screen readers.
