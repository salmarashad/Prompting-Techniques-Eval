ACTION STEP 2:
FR-3: [Requirement related to preconditions or triggers]
FR-4: [Requirement related to process steps or data handling]

REASONING STEP 3:
We need to consider reliability, error conditions, and alternative paths. What happens when things don't work as expected?

ACTION STEP 3:
FR-5: [Requirement addressing error handling or alternative flows]
FR-6: [Requirement addressing backup functionality or notifications]
NFR-1: [Non-functional requirement related to performance or timing]

REASONING STEP 4:
Let's consider user experience, accessibility, and other quality attributes important for this feature.

ACTION STEP 4:
NFR-2: [Non-functional requirement related to user interface or experience]
NFR-3: [Non-functional requirement related to quality attributes like accessibility or security]

","FR-1: The system shall allow users to search for other users based on shared health goals, specified as keywords or pre-defined categories.
FR-2: The system shall display a list of users matching the search criteria, including a brief profile summary showing relevant health goals and a way to initiate a connection request.
FR-3: Users must create a profile and specify their health goals before being searchable by other users.
FR-4: When a user sends a connection request, the recipient shall receive a notification and be able to accept or decline the request.
FR-5: The system shall display an error message if no users are found matching the search criteria.
FR-6: The system shall notify the requesting user if their connection request is accepted or declined within 24 hours.
NFR-1: Search results shall be displayed within 2 seconds.
NFR-2: The user interface for searching and connecting with other users shall be intuitive and easy to navigate, adhering to accessibility guidelines (WCAG 2.1 Level AA).
NFR-3: User profiles and connection data shall be stored securely, adhering to data privacy regulations (e.g., GDPR, CCPA).

Let's solve this requirement engineering task using a Reasoning-Action loop.

USER STORY:
As a user, I want to be able to connect with other users who have similar health goals so that I can receive support and motivation.

REASONING STEP 1:
Let's identify the core functionality requested in this user story. What is the primary action or outcome the user expects?

ACTION STEP 1:
FR-1: [Primary functional requirement based on the core need]
FR-2: [Secondary functional requirement that supports the core need]
