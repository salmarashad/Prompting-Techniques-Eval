","Okay, here's the conversion of the user story ""As a customer, I want to be able to view the nutritional information and allergen information for each menu item so that I can make informed choices"" into specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound functional and non-functional requirements:

**Functional Requirements:**

*   **FR-1: Menu Item Display:** The system shall display each menu item with a clearly labeled section for nutritional information and a separate, clearly labeled section for allergen information.
*   **FR-2: Nutritional Information Content:**  For each menu item, the nutritional information section shall display, at minimum, the following per serving: calories, total fat (in grams), saturated fat (in grams), trans fat (in grams), cholesterol (in milligrams), sodium (in milligrams), total carbohydrates (in grams), dietary fiber (in grams), total sugars (in grams), and protein (in grams).
*   **FR-3: Allergen Information Content:** For each menu item, the allergen information section shall clearly indicate whether the menu item contains any of the following allergens: gluten, crustaceans, eggs, fish, peanuts, tree nuts, soybeans, milk, sesame, and mustard. If an item contains any of these, it must be explicitly stated. If it does not, the system shall state that the item is free of the listed allergens.
*   **FR-4: Accessibility:** The nutritional and allergen information shall be easily accessible from the menu item's main display page or section, requiring no more than one click or tap to view.
*   **FR-5: Data Source Verification:** The system shall maintain a record of the source of the nutritional and allergen information for each menu item and display the date of the last information update.
*   **FR-6: Search and Filtering:** The system shall allow customers to filter menu items based on specific allergens. For example, a customer should be able to filter to only show menu items that do not contain gluten.

**Non-Functional Requirements:**

*   **NFR-1: Data Accuracy:** The nutritional and allergen information displayed shall be accurate to within +/- 5% of the values provided by the supplier or determined through lab testing.
*   **NFR-2: Information Loading Speed:** The nutritional and allergen information for a menu item shall load within 2 seconds of the menu item's display page loading under normal load conditions.
*   **NFR-3: Data Update Frequency:** The system shall be updated with the latest nutritional and allergen information at least quarterly, or more frequently if there are any changes to the menu item's ingredients or preparation methods.
*   **NFR-4: Compliance:** The system shall comply with all applicable food labeling regulations and guidelines related to nutritional and allergen information display (e.g., FDA regulations in the US).
*   **NFR-5: Responsiveness:** The display of nutritional and allergen information shall be responsive and adapt to different screen sizes (desktop, tablet, mobile) without loss of readability or functionality.
*   **NFR-6: Accessibility:** The nutritional and allergen information shall be accessible to users with disabilities, adhering to WCAG (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines) 2.1 Level AA standards.

**Explanation of Choices and Considerations:**

*   **Specificity:**  The requirements are specific about *what* information needs to be displayed and *how* it should be displayed.
*   **Measurability:**  NFRs include metrics like loading speed (2 seconds), data accuracy (+/- 5%), and update frequency (quarterly). FRs include metrics like requiring one click to view the content.
*   **Achievability:** The requirements are realistic and can be implemented with reasonable effort and resources.
*   **Relevance:**  The requirements directly address the user's need to make informed choices based on nutritional and allergen information.
*   **Time-Bound:**  The data update frequency (quarterly) is a time-bound constraint. NFR-2 also provides a time bound constraint.
*   **Compliance:**  NFR-4 explicitly addresses the need to comply with relevant regulations, which is crucial for food-related applications.
*   **Accessibility:** NFR-6 emphasizes accessibility for users with disabilities, which is an important consideration for inclusive design.
*   **Data Source:** FR-5 ensures transparency regarding the source and currency of the information.

This breakdown provides a solid foundation for developers to implement the feature and for testers to verify its functionality and performance. Remember to adapt these requirements based on the specific context of your application and target audience.
