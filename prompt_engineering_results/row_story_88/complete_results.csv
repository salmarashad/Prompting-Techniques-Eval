Let's solve this requirement engineering task using a Reasoning-Action loop.

USER STORY:
As a user, I want to be able to download e-books for offline reading so that I can read without an internet connection.

REASONING STEP 1:
Let's identify the core functionality requested in this user story. What is the primary action or outcome the user expects?

ACTION STEP 1:
FR-1: [Primary functional requirement based on the core need]
FR-2: [Secondary functional requirement that supports the core need]

REASONING STEP 2:
Now let's consider the triggers, conditions, and context for this functionality. What needs to happen before, during, and after the main function?

ACTION STEP 2:
FR-3: [Requirement related to preconditions or triggers]
FR-4: [Requirement related to process steps or data handling]

REASONING STEP 3:
We need to consider reliability, error conditions, and alternative paths. What happens when things don't work as expected?

ACTION STEP 3:
FR-5: [Requirement addressing error handling or alternative flows]
FR-6: [Requirement addressing backup functionality or notifications]
NFR-1: [Non-functional requirement related to performance or timing]

REASONING STEP 4:
Let's consider user experience, accessibility, and other quality attributes important for this feature.

ACTION STEP 4:
NFR-2: [Non-functional requirement related to user interface or experience]
NFR-3: [Non-functional requirement related to quality attributes like accessibility or security]

FINAL REQUIREMENTS:

","FR-1: The system shall allow users to download e-books to their device for offline access.
FR-2: The system shall provide a clear indication of download progress for each e-book.
FR-3: The user must be logged in to the system before being able to download e-books.
FR-4: The system shall store downloaded e-books in a dedicated storage location on the user's device.
FR-5: The system shall display an error message if the download fails due to insufficient storage space.
FR-6: The system shall automatically resume interrupted downloads when network connectivity is restored.
NFR-1: E-books shall download at a rate of at least 1 MB per second on a standard broadband connection (25 Mbps).
NFR-2: The user interface for downloading e-books shall be intuitive and easy to navigate on both mobile and desktop devices.
NFR-3: Downloaded e-books shall be encrypted to protect against unauthorized access.
