","FR-1: User shall be able to create a new post containing text, images, or both.
FR-2: The system shall allow the user to specify the privacy setting for the post (e.g., public, friends only, specific groups).
FR-3: User must be logged in to their account to create a post.
FR-4: The system shall store the post content, timestamp, author, and privacy settings in the database upon successful creation.
FR-5: The system shall display an error message to the user if the post creation fails (e.g., due to network error, invalid image format, exceeding character limit).
FR-6: The system shall provide a draft-saving functionality, allowing users to save incomplete posts and return to them later for completion.
NFR-1: Post creation should complete within 3 seconds under normal network conditions.
NFR-2: The post creation interface shall be intuitive and easy to use, with clear instructions and visual cues.
NFR-3: The system shall ensure that posts are only visible to authorized users based on the privacy settings specified by the post creator.

Let's solve this requirement engineering task using a Reasoning-Action loop.

USER STORY:
As a user, I want to be able to create posts on my social media account, such as status updates or photos.

REASONING STEP 1:
Let's identify the core functionality requested in this user story. What is the primary action or outcome the user expects?

ACTION STEP 1:
FR-1: [Primary functional requirement based on the core need]
FR-2: [Secondary functional requirement that supports the core need]

REASONING STEP 2:
Now let's consider the triggers, conditions, and context for this functionality. What needs to happen before, during, and after the main function?

ACTION STEP 2:
FR-3: [Requirement related to preconditions or triggers]
FR-4: [Requirement related to process steps or data handling]

REASONING STEP 3:
We need to consider reliability, error conditions, and alternative paths. What happens when things don't work as expected?

ACTION STEP 3:
FR-5: [Requirement addressing error handling or alternative flows]
FR-6: [Requirement addressing backup functionality or notifications]
NFR-1: [Non-functional requirement related to performance or timing]

REASONING STEP 4:
Let's consider user experience, accessibility, and other quality attributes important for this feature.

ACTION STEP 4:
NFR-2: [Non-functional requirement related to user interface or experience]
NFR-3: [Non-functional requirement related to quality attributes like accessibility or security]

","FR-1: The system shall allow users to create a new post including text content and optionally attached media (images/videos).
FR-2: The system shall store the post content, timestamp, and user ID in the database.
FR-3: The user must be logged in to the system before creating a post.
FR-4: The system shall validate post content to ensure it does not exceed a maximum character limit (e.g., 280 characters).
FR-5: The system shall display an error message to the user if the post creation fails (e.g., due to network error or invalid content).
FR-6: The system shall save a draft of the post if the user navigates away from the post creation page before submitting it, allowing them to resume later.
NFR-1: The system shall create a post within 2 seconds of the user submitting it.
NFR-2: The post creation interface shall be intuitive and easy to use on both desktop and mobile devices.
NFR-3: The system shall ensure that all uploaded media is scanned for malware before being stored and displayed.
