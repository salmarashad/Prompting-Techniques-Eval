*   **Achievable:**  The requirements are realistic and attainable with reasonable development effort.
*   **Relevant:**  All requirements directly relate to the user story of splitting bills with friends.
*   **Time-Bound:**  While not every requirement has an explicit time constraint, the performance requirements are time-bound.  The data retention requirement specifies a minimum duration. Also the speed measurements.

This provides a more comprehensive set of requirements that can be used for development, testing, and validation. Remember to tailor these further based on your specific project context and technical constraints.

ACTION STEP 2:
FR-3: [Requirement related to preconditions or triggers]
FR-4: [Requirement related to process steps or data handling]

REASONING STEP 3:
We need to consider reliability, error conditions, and alternative paths. What happens when things don't work as expected?

ACTION STEP 3:
